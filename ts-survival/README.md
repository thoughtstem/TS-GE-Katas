# ts-camp-jam-1

This is a Kata Collection that combines the battle-arena language
  with a gamification strategy that works well for a series of day-long camps
  where some students may be returning each day and some may not.

Constraints:

* Any student should be able to start on any day as if it were their first day
* Any student should be able to come on multiple days and find new value in each day's experience.
  - Repetitions should be fun not boring.
