# TS COACH

This is a set of meta-katas dealing with various themes:

1) What Katas are.
2) How to introduce katas to students.
3) How to train students using katas.
4) How to test a student on a kata.
5) How to reward students after katas.

## Usual stuff

This is a new kata collection.  Use the following to generate
kata web page from kata collection defined in `katas.rkt`.

```
raco build-kata-docs
```

Index page will be in:

```
doc/manual/index.html
```

Use this `README.md` for developer notes.  It gets displayed nicely on github, so 
phrase things here like you're talking to developers.

But this file is mostly for installation notes, gotchas, etc.  Things that differ from the norm.

For more detailed documentation, use Scribble.

For todos, use Github tickets.
