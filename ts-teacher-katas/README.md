#ts-coaches

Practicing the craft of coaching is a key part
of becoming a better coach.  What's cool is that we
can actually use kata-based learning to help you learn
how to be a better coach for kata-based classes.

This repository of katas is intended for this reason.

These are katas to help you become a better coach
for classes that use kata-based curriculum.

NOTE: Many of these katas are meta-katas.  The stimulus will
be a student kata, the expected response is a description
of how a coach would use that kata during class, add scaffolding,
break it down, explain the concepts, etc.

These katas are intended to be done with other coaches,
generally in a classful of other coaches.  Those coaches
are inteded to act as students for the coach performing
the kata.
