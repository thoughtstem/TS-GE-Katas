Embed image into scribble automatically
  ts-kata-util/assets/main

  Working but need to: find . | grep compiled/ | xargs rm 

Make a way to credit the authors/artists...

Change scribbles to include-extracted from the direct path, no intermediate provide-extracted

People can just assets get with (require battle-arena/assets)
  > But should provide all out
  
Do this in starwars-battle-arena/
  Propagate to prototye-language/



Think long and hard about the string substitution... Is it going to get us into trouble later?
  --> If it seems safeish just start building and see where it breaks down.


Doc this:
(define/contract/doc )
  -> Allows: (require lang-name/mappings )

(with-mappings-from lang-name/mappings
  ...)
(define-example-code/from ...)
(define-example-code/from* ...)

Skinned langs:
  Begin hand-crafting a skinned lang
    - Have starwars battle arena prototype 
  Create tools
    - Have language tools for making a skinned lang
    - Add to prototype-lang (so all langs have mappings by default; all langs are skinned; who knows what you're skinning...?)  
       [could auto-generate that mapping file and first example]
  Write code
  Doc things
  Make the second time easier. 

Generate .gitignore files for prototype-langs



Instead of learning new things: Catch up to yourself.  Faster.
