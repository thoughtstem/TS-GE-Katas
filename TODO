Can't install starwars-battle-arena

On pkg install for starwars (why??)
  require: unknown module
    module name: #<resolved-module-path:(submod "/Users/thoughtstem/Dev/TS/TS-Languages/starwars-battle-arena/lang/main.rkt" mappings)>
    compilation context...:


auto-gen (run:...) from /from*

Think long and hard about the string substitution... Is it going to get us into trouble later?
  --> If it seems safeish just start building and see where it breaks down.

(define/contract/doc )
(require lang-name/mappings )

[???WHAT BRIDGES THE GAP???]
[substitutions...]

(define-example-code/from ...)
(define-example-code/from* ...)

Skinned langs:
  Begin hand-crafting a skinned lang
    - Have starwars battle arena prototype 
  Create tools
    - Have language tools for making a skinned lang
    - Add to prototype-lang (so all langs have mappings by default; all langs are skinned; who knows what you're skinning...?)  
       [could auto-generate that mapping file and first example]
  Write code
  Doc things
  Make the second time easier. 

Generate .gitignore files for prototype-langs



define/contract/doc needs some work, it requires a keyword for some reason...
Instead of learning new things: Catch up to yourself.  Faster.

WEDNESDAY
  - Stephen pivots to online course stuff 
  - Orr..... Stephen has to work on backend bullshit for a while.  We'll see...

BY THURSDAY AND During ireland:
  Start breaking down this project with the team.  Structure of kata collections?  Design process?  Todos?  Meta katas for "copyright law"...
  ...

  Extended languages...  Language skins...
  Starwars and the rest...
