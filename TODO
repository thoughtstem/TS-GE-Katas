Separate into 
  ts-survival 
    Add stimuli
  ts-survival-asp-winter-2019
    Remove health bars
    Put back other sections... (game jam, e.g.)
    Fix "Unknown ___ Kata", looks silly


Survival:
  Redo assets+docs
    survival
      bat-sprite?

  Any broken examples? (get run: working again...)



Don't hardcode the battle-arena string sub in ts-kata-util

Don't generate run:*, but do make a run-example function...
   We've lost the identifier checking
     but that's okay?  Generate unit test with (run-example ...) ;But don't do (headless ...) game engine specific...
   Also it's broken... fix???

Document end-to-end demo 
  --> battle-arena
  --> battle-arena-starwars
  --> ts-battle-arena
  --> ts-battle-arena-starwars
  --> ts-battle-arena-starwars-summer-camps-2019 




Make a way to credit the authors/artists...

Change scribbles to include-extracted from the direct path, no intermediate provide-extracted

People can just assets get with (require battle-arena/assets)
  > But should provide all out
  
Do this in starwars-battle-arena/
  Propagate to prototye-language/



Think long and hard about the string substitution... Is it going to get us into trouble later?
  --> If it seems safeish just start building and see where it breaks down.


Doc this:
(define/contract/doc )
  -> Allows: (require lang-name/mappings )

(with-mappings-from lang-name/mappings
  ...)
(define-example-code/from ...)
(define-example-code/from* ...)

Skinned langs:
  Begin hand-crafting a skinned lang
    - Have starwars battle arena prototype 
  Create tools
    - Have language tools for making a skinned lang
    - Add to prototype-lang (so all langs have mappings by default; all langs are skinned; who knows what you're skinning...?)  
       [could auto-generate that mapping file and first example]
  Write code
  Doc things
  Make the second time easier. 

Generate .gitignore files for prototype-langs



Instead of learning new things: Catch up to yourself.  Faster.

WEDNESDAY
  - Stephen pivots to online course stuff 
  - Orr..... Stephen has to work on backend bullshit for a while.  We'll see...

BY THURSDAY AND During ireland:
  Start breaking down this project with the team.  Structure of kata collections?  Design process?  Todos?  Meta katas for "copyright law"...
  ...

  Extended languages...  Language skins...
  Starwars and the rest...
