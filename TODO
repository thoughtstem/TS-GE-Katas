* Start ts-coaches, put in meta katas.  Leave in a state for us to make more later.
  > Might need to rewrite the rendering system.  Abstractions are breaking down.
    -> Give make-stimulus->X?
  > Get rendering of meta katas to make sense.  Broken now.   Weirdness with section/subsection/etc
    > Be careful not to break regular kata rendering
  > Define the various kinds of meta katas we might want
    > ts-coaches      : Meta katas -> 1) How to teach a kata, 2) How to make a kata, 3) What is a kata?
  > Define some useful example katas (using above types)


* Get installation to be perfect (Kata collections & Languages)
* Recreate ts-fundamentals
  > Put in some unplugged activities (will be prototypes for K-2 classes...)
    - Also prototypes for examples in Don't Teach Coding book
* Make sure all renderings of katas look good and are clear:
