Make sure build-l still works in non-skinned repos

Think long and hard about the string substitution... Is it going to get us into trouble later?
  --> If it seems safeish just start building and see where it breaks down.


Doc this:
(define/contract/doc )
  -> Allows: (require lang-name/mappings )

(with-mappings-from lang-name/mappings
  ...)
(define-example-code/from ...)
(define-example-code/from* ...)

Skinned langs:
  Begin hand-crafting a skinned lang
    - Have starwars battle arena prototype 
  Create tools
    - Have language tools for making a skinned lang
    - Add to prototype-lang (so all langs have mappings by default; all langs are skinned; who knows what you're skinning...?)  
       [could auto-generate that mapping file and first example]
  Write code
  Doc things
  Make the second time easier. 

Generate .gitignore files for prototype-langs



define/contract/doc needs some work, it requires a keyword for some reason...
Instead of learning new things: Catch up to yourself.  Faster.
