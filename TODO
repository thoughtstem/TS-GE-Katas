auto-gen (run:...) from /from*

#lang line on generated examples is wrong (battle-arena instead of starwars-battle-arena).   How to specify the current lang?

(define/contract/doc )
(require lang-name/mappings )

[???WHAT BRIDGES THE GAP???]
[substitutions...]

(define-example-code/from ...)
(define-example-code/from* ...)

Skinned langs:
  Begin hand-crafting a skinned lang
    - Have starwars battle arena prototype 
  Create tools
    - Have language tools for making a skinned lang
    - Add to prototype-lang (so all langs have mappings by default; all langs are skinned; who knows what you're skinning...?)  
       [could auto-generate that mapping file and first example]
  Write code
  Doc things
  Make the second time easier. 

Generate .gitignore files for prototype-langs



define/contract/doc needs some work, it requires a keyword for some reason...
Instead of learning new things: Catch up to yourself.  Faster.
