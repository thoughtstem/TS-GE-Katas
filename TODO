Skinned langs:
  Begin hand-crafting a skinned lang
    - Have starwars battle arena prototype 
  Create tools
    - Have language tools for making a skinned lang
    - Add to prototype-lang (so all langs have mappings by default; all langs are skinned; who knows what you're skinning...?)  
       [could auto-generate that mapping file and first example]
  Write code
  Doc things
  Make the second time easier. 

Generate .gitignore files for prototype-langs



Instead of learning new things: Catch up to yourself.  Faster.
