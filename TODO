Rewrite autogenerated READMEs for Langs and Katas
  - Replace any previously generated ones

Look at Sara's (quote red) issue

Make that custom twilik avatar actually work...

Don't throw away args in battle-arena-game

Make tickets for different kinds of katas:
  Coding katas - Skill building
  Lore   katas - Data structure concepts
  Law    katas



Better errors if you run build-l or build-k in the wrong kind of dir

Document:
  A typical lang
  A typical kata collection

  -> In generated README.md
  -> In a more general place -- e.g. TS-Kata-Collections and/or TS-Langauges

Document end-to-end demo 
  --> battle-arena
  --> battle-arena-starwars
  --> ts-battle-arena
  --> ts-battle-arena-starwars
  --> ts-battle-arena-starwars-summer-camps-2019 

Make a way to credit the authors/artists...

Think long and hard about the string substitution... Is it going to get us into trouble later?
  --> If it seems safeish just start building and see where it breaks down.
  --> UPDATE: I think it'll work.  Substitution just needs to give us some loose mappings for examples.
      Most of the fun in a skinned lang will come from:
      1) New assets
      2) New definitions
      3) Fandom specific katas
         Meta fandom katas: Copyright law, etc.
         Actual fandom katas: Stuff related to the fandom...

Doc 
  lang-mappings
  Other exports from ts-kata-util/main

Generate .gitignore files for prototype-langs

Instead of learning new things: Catch up to yourself.  Faster.

MONDAY AND During ireland:
  Start breaking down this project with the team.  Structure of kata collections?  Design process?  Todos?  Meta katas for "copyright law"...
  ...

  Extended languages...  Language skins...
  Starwars and the rest...
