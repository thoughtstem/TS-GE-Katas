;Do docs: Include justifications for
;  Number printed
;  Ordering
;  What's on the back

;  Intended use-case: one deck can do any kata in the collection -- and any
;     new kata -- as long as it doesn't require more of any identifier than appears in
;     some kata in the collection.

;  Asset card extras.  Print separately -- but maybe in the same job...


; Order cards

;Tomorrow: Shared decks
