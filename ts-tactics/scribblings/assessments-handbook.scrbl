@title{ThoughtSTEM Language Assessment Handbook}

@section{Introduction}

Welcome!  This handbook discusses the theory and practice of assessments at ThoughtSTEM.  It also articulates general expectations for how students should grow as software developers.  This document can be used to guide assessments.

As a gentle introduction, this is an example assessment:

@(skill-plot (report (k-2-year-1)))

This document is intended to explain what such assessments mean, how they can be performed, and the science that provides the groundwork for them.

Assessments are critical for identifying a student's strengths and weaknesses.  They can also be used to set expectations and to determine if students are meeting those expectations.  Our assessment model has been designed to allows us to  comparisons of individuals with diverse backgrounds.  For example, here is a comparative assessment of the expected skill level of an second grader who has been training for 3 years to the expected skill level of a 9th grader who has been training for 1 year. 

@(compare-two
  #:title "9th-grader vs 2nd-grader"
  #:labels '("2nd-grader (3 years)" "9th-grader (1 year)")
  (k-2-year-3)
  (9th-12th-year-1))

The major sections of this book cover the core concepts of assessments, step-by-step processes for performing those assessments, and some benchmarks assessments (e.g. the skill expectations for ThoughtSTEM students after various years of training).

@section{Assessments in Theory}

Educational assessments always have two components:

@itemize[
  @item{Theory}
  @item{Practice}
]

First, we'll discuss the underlying theory of assessments, then we'll discuss how assessments are actually done in practice. 
The theory is key to actually understanding the results of the assessment done in practice -- which is why we start with the theory. 

@subsection{The Six Roles}

There are six roles that all software developers must play at various times throughout their career.  Gone are the days where coders only needed to know how to code.  The 21st century coder must be more than a coder:

@itemize[@item{@(coder-definition)}
         @item{@(communicator-definition)}
         @item{@(collaborator-definition)}
         @item{@(leader-definition)}
         @item{@(teacher-definition)}
         @item{@(architect-definition)}]

@subsection{Skill Levels}


There are 5 skill levels:

@itemize[@item{@level-1}
         @item{@level-2}
         @item{@level-3}
         @item{@level-4}
         @item{@level-5}]

Our model of expertise is a modification of the well-known Dreyfus Model.  When it comes to the Dreyfus Model, it's imperative to remember that the distance between @level-1 and @level-5 is gigantic.  

@margin-note{
It is, in fact, much larger than most @Novice @Coders realize.  This is why we uses badges and other symbols to mark student progress during class.  These can be given out more regularly and can help sustain motivation better than levels in the above model.  
}

Students can become disheartened when they realize hard truths, such as: it may take a year or more to go from @level-1 to @level-2; and that becoming an @Expert may take many years of hard work and deliberate practice.  

The assessments in this document are good for comparing students, but not always great for motivating them.  This should be made clear to any student being assessed.  It is important that they know that there is no shame in being assessed at @level-1 -- and that even assessments of @level-2 are a big deal.

To define these terms more clearly, let us try to get a sense of what @Expert means and work backwards from there.  The following, taken together, help define @Expert, in the context of the Dreyfus model.

@margin-note{
  Note that the Dreyfus Model was developed as a general-purpose tool for discussing expertise across a wide range of fields -- not just computer science.  
}

@itemize[
@item{An @bold{Expert} performs tasks significantly better than a @bold{Novice}}
@item{An @bold{Expert} can perform @emph{unconsciously} at a level that a @bold{Novice} cannot achieve even with total focus and concentration.  An expert chess player, for example, can play a strong game of chess while multi-tasking -- easily beating a @bold{Novice} who is trying their best.  Likewise, an Expert pianist can play a complicated piece of music from memory while carrying on a converstation; whereas a @bold{Novice} would be unable to play the piece at all.}
@item{An @bold{Expert} makes an extremely high level of skill look effortless and easy.  Someone who is @bold{Competent} or @bold{Proficient} may have an extremely high level of skill, but only an @bold{Expert} has so internalized those skills that they scarcely need to devote their working memory to it at all.} 
@item{Most computer science college graduates are @emph{not} @bold{Expert} coders.}
@item{Most straight-A computer science graduates are, at best, @bold{Proficient} coders.  Many graduates are @bold{Advanced Beginners} and @bold{Competent} -- both of which can be sufficient for obtaining a job in the modern software workforce.}
@item{Most computer science graduates are, at best, @bold{Competent} communicators.}
@item{Most computer science graduates are, at best, @bold{Advanced Beginner} collaborators.}
@item{Most computer science graduates are, at best, @bold{Novice} teachers, leaders, and architects.}
@item{Some, but not all, graduates gain @Expertise in these areas later, after working in the workforce for many years.}
]

Students should bear this in mind -- the assessment model is designed to make comparisons between people who have only just begun to learn coding, as well as incoming college students, college graduates, working programmers, senior developers, and software architects.  Obviously, the range between @level-1 and @level-5 @emph{has} to be vast in order to capture the massive range of human skill that we find when we examine the programmers that live on the planet Earth today.

One thing that can help make the vastness less vast is a concept we call: @Parameterized-Expertise .  That is, even a @Novice can have a degree of @Expertise in @emph{specific sub-domains within the larger field of @Expertise}:

@itemize[
  @item{A @Novice pianist may be able to play certain songs at an @Expert level}
  @item{A @Novice chess player may be able to play chess positions as well as an @Expert (e.g. certain standard end-game and opening positions)}
  @item{A @Novice programmer may know certain domain specific languages as well as an @Expert does.}
]

This @Parameterized-Expertise is easier to assess, and such assessments can be used to estimate an individual's "theoretical @Expertise".  We can gain more and more confidence about a student's level of theoretical @Expertise the longer and more deeply we assess their @Parameterized-Expertise in various sub-domains, but we can never know the true value for certain.  Presumably, if someone can perform as well as an @Expert in all sub-domains, then one is truly an @Expert; but exhaustively testing an @Expert on all possible sub-domains can take an infinite amount of time.

For example, if we were assessing pianists, we might choose as assessment parameters certain difficult songs, e.g.:
 
@itemize[
@item{@bold{Concierto Difficulto}}
@item{@bold{Ã‰tude Requiring 12 Fingers}}
@item{@bold{Cannon in F#, A#, B#, and E# major}}
]

Asking a pianist to learn and perform these songs is a good way to assess their skill level.  But the results must be interpreted as incomplete.  Someone who performs all three songs at an @Expert level might @emph{only} be able to perform those three songs -- which would not qualify them to be a true @Expert, but merely an @Expert on the chosen parameters.  Still, this is better than trying to test someone on all possible songs -- which would take an infinite amount of time. 

To make it clear that all measures of @Expertise are really measures of @Parameterized-Expertise, we always include when discussing assessments.  They are part of the complete story.  That is why you'll always see "langs: X" printed on the bottom bar of a coding assessment:

@(skill-plot (report (9th-12th-year-1)))

The lang number gives a sense of how to interpret the assessment data.  An even deeper sense can be derived by examining the details of the languages on which the student was assessed.

In other words, being aware of the parameters of an assessment helps to bridge the qualitative/quantitative gap.  The raw number (e.g. @level-3) give us a quantitative level of expertise as an average across all of the assessed parameters (in this case, languages); the parameters themselves help tell us qualitatively what sorts of things the individual's raw score pertains to.

@subsection{Assessment Theory, in Conclusion}

To sum up the above, there is a theoretical model that provides the foundation for the @Expertise assessments in the following section:

@itemize[
  @item{For any give domain (music, chess, coding, for example) there is a model of expertise known as the Dreyfus Model, which identifies 5 major milestones on the road to expert: @Novice, @Advanced-Beginner, @Competent, @Proficient, @Expert .}
  @item{The @Expert mind can do effortlessly and intuitively what the @Novice mind cannot, even with intense concentration.}
  @item{Assessing true @Expertise in broad domains like "Coding" or "Piano" can be difficult; but assessing @Parameterized-Expertise can be much easier, provided that one can find suitable parameters.}
  @item{In coding, an obvious parameter is language -- which is why ThoughtSTEM assessments are always in terms of @Expertise across some number of languages.}
  @item{The assessments themselves seek to classify the assessed individual into one of the categories @Novice, @Advanced-Beginner, @Competent, @Proficient, or @Expert for some parameter language. }
]

@section{Assessments In Practice}

When assessing any student for the first time, the assessment begins by assigning a @level-1 in each of the major categories.  In pictographic form: 

@(skill-plot (report (total-novice)))

Using the test algorithms in the following section, the assessor and the individual being assessed iteratively nudge the above model asymptotically toward a true assessment of the individual's expertise. 

Before beginning this processes, it is important to decide how many tests to run.  Considering why the assessment is being produced can assist with this.  Example use-cases might be: 

@itemize[
  @item{@bold{Learning conferences} -- wherein students are assessed by ThoughtSTEM staff upon request (or invitation) to facilitate the co-creation of personalized learning plans.}
  @item{@bold{Scientific publications}    -- to show statistically significant correlations between ThoughtSTEM pedagogical techniques and learning outcomes.}
]

Obviously, the level of rigor in the first case can be relaxed compared to the second.  To show statistical significance, more tests must be done, and the assessment process must be very formal.  For learning conferences, however, it is more important to reach a consensus between parent, student, and assessor than it is to discover an absolute number.  Often, consensus can be achieved simply by explaining the theory behind the assessment, coming to a mutual understanding of:

@itemize[
  @item{@bold{The 6 Skill Types}: Coder, Communicator, Collaborator, Leader, Teacher, and Architect.}
  @item{@bold{The 5 Skill Levels}: Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, and Expert.}
]

For example, many @bold{Advanced Beginners} with a traditional coding background (a few years of classes) will erroneously believe they are @bold{Experts} until you describe the characteristics of an @bold{Expert} and discuss the procedure for testing for expertise.  Usually, then, students are able to modify their own definitions and appropriately categorize themselves.  If a consensus cannot be reached through discussion, one or two tests is usually enough to help the student self-categorize.  Once consensus is reached, the assessment can begin doing its job as a tool to aid future discussions.

The quicker an assessment can begin do its job, the better.  So assessors should try to minimize the number of tests they run.  With that in mind, the tests are as follows.

@subsection{Assessment Test Algorithms}

The high level assessment loop is as follows:

@tactic->scribble[
  (list
    (instruction 'Assessor (verb "Pick a language L"))
  (until (predicate "is reached" "desired confidence")
    (instruction 'Assessor (directed-action
                             (verb "Pick a role type to assess")
                             ":"
                             "Coder, Communicator, Collaborator, Leader, Teacher, Architect"))

    (instruction 'Assessor (verb "go to the appropriate section and run the test algorithm to get a number between 1 and 5"))
    (instruction 'Assessor (branching-verb
                             (predicate "was the first for the current role type" "this test")
                             (verb "this number is the assessed skill level for the current role type")
                             (verb "average this number with the assessed skill level for the current role type")))
    ))
]

Tests are given in subsequent sections and are subject to change as we discover or invent new tests that take less time, require fewer resources, or are easier to administer.    

@subsubsection{Assessing a Coder}

When assessing a @Coder, we use a few different procedures.  In most cases, the first one is sufficient for detecting @Novice, @Advanced-Beginner, and @Competent coders.  The others can help distinguish between @Competent, @Proficient, and @Expert coders.

@bold{1-card test: Novice vs Advanced Beginner Classification}

@tactic->scribble[
        (list
         (until (predicate "produces a number" "rubric")
          (instruction (group-add 'Assessor 'Coder)
           (verb "Seat yourselves across from each other, so that the Assessor cannot see the Coder's screen but can see the Coder's face."))
          (instruction 'Assessor 
           (verb "Randomly select 1 card from language being assessed"))
          (instruction 'Assessor 
           (verb "Read the specification aloud"))
          (instruction 'Assessor 
           (give-to 'Coder "the card specification-side-up"))
          (instruction 'Assessor 
           (say "I'd like you to implement the code from the specification written on the card.  You can touch the card.  You can do anything you want.  There are no rules here.  Just let me know when you're done, and please make sure I can see the card at all times.  I will be grading you according to a rubric printed in this handbook.  Would you like to review it before we begin?"))
          (instruction (group-add 'Assessor 'Coder)
           (verb "discuss the rubric as necessary"))
          (instruction 'Coder
           (verb "implement code from the given specification"))
          (instruction 'Assessor
           (verb "Evaluate according to rubric"))))
]

The rubric is simple:

@itemize[
  @item{If the student looks at the code on the back of the card, the assessment is automatically @bold{1 (Novice)}.}
  @item{If the student produces code that matches the specification but takes longer than 10 minutes, the assessment is @bold{2 (Advanced Beginner)}}
  @item{If if the code at the end does not match the specification, the test must be thrown out.  A new card must be chosen.}
  @item{If the student produces code that matches the specification but takes less than 10 minutes, the test must be thrown out.  Do the @bold{3-card} test next time.}
]


@bold{3-card test: Competent vs Proficient vs Expert Classification}


@tactic->scribble[
(list
 (until (predicate "is reached" "confidence")
 (instruction (group-add 'Assessor 'Coder)
   (verb "Seat yourselves across from each other, so that the Assessor cannot see the Coder's screen but can see the Coder's face."))
 (instruction 'Assessor 
   (verb "Randomly select three cards from language being assessed"))
 (instruction 'Assessor 
   (give-to 'Coder "the cards specification-side-up"))
 (instruction 'Assessor 
   (say "I'd like you to write a single program that matches all three specifications.  You can touch the cards.  You can do anything you want.  There are no rules here.  Just let me know when you're done, and please make sure I can see the cards at all times.  I will be grading you according to a rubric printed in this handbook.  Would you like to review it before we begin?"))
 (instruction (group-add 'Assessor 'Coder)
   (verb "discuss the rubric as necessary"))
 (instruction 'Assessor 
   (say "If you are demonstrating Expertise via the Effortless Talking Rule, you may begin speaking any time before your fingers touch the keyboard."))
 (instruction 'Coder
   (verb "implement code from the given specifications.  (If a feature of one specification conflicts with another such that you cannot do both features, you may choose which feature to implement.)"))
 (instruction 'Assessor
   (verb "Grade according to rubric"))))
]

The rubric is:

@itemize[
  @item{If the student looks at the code on the back of any cards, the assessment is automatically @bold{1 (Novice)}.  The next test should be the 1-card test.}
  @item{If the student produces code that matches the specifications but takes longer than 10 minutes, the assessment is @bold{3 (Competent)}}
  @item{If if the code at the end does not match the specifications, the test must be thrown out.  The next test should be the 1-card test.}
  @item{If the student produces code that matches the specifications in less than 10 minutes, the "Effortless Talking Rule" is applied to distinguish between @bold{Proficient} and @bold{Expert}.}
  @item{The Effortless Talking Rule is this: The assessment is @bold{Expert} if the student can make it look easy and effortless to both talk and code at the same time.  The talking can be about anything; however, it is most common (and perfectly acceptable) for the student to explain what they are doing while they are doing it -- i.e. thinking aloud.  Note that the talking must be at a comfortable conversational pace, without lulls, sentence fragments, evidence of vocal stress, or other such evidence of cognitive load.  After all, that's what the Effortless Talking Rule is testing -- whether or not the student has achieved automatic, effortless, and fluent recall of the target language.}
]

Note that students never "lose points" for making coding errors during the test.  Experts who are demonstrating expertise are free to make mistakes and even to talk about them as they are fixing them -- as long as they can do so effortlessly, and as long as they can deliver a correct program within 10 minutes.  You're not grading their coding process; you are grading their cognitive load, as evidenced by their ability to verbally multitask while coding.

@margin-note{
  Note that this makes ThoughtSTEM assessments considerably more rigorous than assessments in traditional education.  College-level computer science classes almost exclusively assess students on their output -- not on how effortlessly the student produced that output.  This leaves a major gap in the assessment model currently used in higher education.  At ThougtSTEM we close that gap when assessing @Coders .
}

@subsubsection{Assessing a Communicator}

Note that @Communicators must be assessed in pairs.  The reason for this should be obvious.  Each of the following @Communicator tests involve communication with a partner.  An individual being assessed (which we'll refer to as @racket[Communicator-A]) may bring a partner, or the assessor may supply one or take on the role of the partner.  

@margin-note{In cases where accuracy is important -- e.g. for scientific publications -- the individual should be assessed with many @Coders across a range of @Expertise levels.}

In many cases, the evaluation criteria is whether both partners' code, at the end of the test, is @bold{isomorphic}.

Two pieces of code are @bold{isomorphic} if:

@itemize[
  @item{They both match the same specification.}
  @item{Either could be transformed into the other simply by renaming variables and functions.}
]

@bold{1-card test: Novice vs Advanced Beginner Classification}
@tactic->scribble[
(list
 (until (predicate "produces a number" "rubric")
  (instruction (group-add 'Communicator-B 'Communicator-A )
   (verb "Sit facing away from each other, close enough that you can hear each other easily, but you should not be able to see each other or each other's computers."))
  (instruction 'Assessor 
   (verb "Randomly select 1 card from language being assessed"))
  (instruction 'Assessor 
   (directed-action
   (verb "Give the card")
   "to"
   'Communicator-A))
  (instruction 'Assessor 
   (say "I'd like you to both implement the code from the specification written on the card.  You may both communicate at any time, using any spoke words you wish -- but you may not use any means of visual communication.  I will be grading your verbal communication according to the rubric in this handbook.  Would you like to review it with me before we begin?."))
  (instruction (group-add 'Assessor 'Communicators)
   (verb "discuss the rubric as necessary"))
  (instruction 'Communicator-A
   (verb "implement code from the given specification and communicate with your partner at will."))
  (instruction 'Assessor
   (verb "Evaluate according to rubric"))))
]


The rubric is as follows:

@itemize[
  @item{If either individual ever dictates individual characters to be typed (e.g. "type a parenthesis"), the assessment for both of them is automatically @level-1}
  @item{If the pair produces code that matches the specification and is identical but takes longer than 10 minutes, the assessment is @level-2} 
  @item{If if the code at the end does not match the specification or the code on each computer is not @bold{isomorphic}, the test must be thrown out.  A new card must be chosen.}
  @item{If the pair produces code that matches the specification and is @bold{isomorphic} but takes less than 10 minutes, the test must be thrown out.  Do the @bold{3-card} test next time.}
]


@bold{3-card test: Competent vs Proficient vs Expert Classification}

]

@margin-note{
  Code communication is a broad-spectrum skill that involves the ability to communicate about specifications, implementations, and running programs in a variety of ways: verbally, visually, and in writing.  We will add more tests here if and when it becomes important to be able to assess other parts of this communication spectrum.  For now, we leverage the fact that fluent verbal communication is a strong indicator of the ability to communicate in other ways.
}


@subsubsection{Assessing a Collaborator}

At ThoughtSTEM, we currently do not run scientific assessments on @Collaborators, @Leaders, @Teachers, or @Architects -- due to the length of time, and number of people, such assessments would take.  Capturing and observing these high-level industry skills in a laboratory setting has been a vexing issue in the history of computer science education research.

However, the theory behind ThoughtSTEM assessments can still serve as a crucial communication tool for discussing how students can calibrate their ability to self-assess their growth as as @Collaborator, @Leader, @Teacher, or @Architect .  

To facilitate such discussions and/or the design of future assessments, we provide below the definitions of @Collaborator, @Leader, @Teacher, and @Architect -- paired with a brief discussion of how to assess (or self-assess) these skills.


@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@(italic 
  @bold{Definition: }
  (collaborator-definition))
}

@bold{Why is this hard to assess?}  It all comes down to basic math.  There are many languages -- which already makes it difficult to assess someone's skill as a @Coder .  When assessing a @Communicator, the assessment becomes trickier -- due to the fact that the @Communicator must be assessed with a partner @Communicator (and there can be many possible partner @Communicators).    But when assessing a @Collaborator, there are @emph{even more} parameters -- that is, the various team of @Communicators the individual might be placed on.  Someone who excells on a team of @Expert @Communicators might flounder in a team of @Advanced-Beginner @Communicators or a mixed team of @Expert @Communicators and @Novice @Communicators, and so on.  Likewise, a student might excell in teams of two but struggle in teams of four.

A truly @Expert collaborator, by definition, can enhance @emph{any} team they are a part of, large or small, skilled or unskilled, or mixed.  This means that a good laboratory assessment would require placing the individual on many different teams and running multiple assessments.  This is nearly impossible to do in a lab, due to the number of people required.

However, it is much easier for a student to do in a ThoughtSTEM class -- where they are routinely being placed in different teams with diverse members.   

@margin-note{
@bold{Discussion Topic:} How can a ThoughtSTEM student actively seek out growth opportunities as a @Collaborator ?}

@margin-note{
@bold{Discussion Topic:} How can ThoughtSTEM coaches actively actively nurture @Collaborators ?}

@subsubsection{Assessing a Leader}

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@(italic
  @bold{Definition: }
  (leader-definition))
}

This is hard to assess, for the same reason that @Collaborators are hard to assess.  There are many kinds of teams, and to assess the true @Expertise of a @Leader, they need to be assessed on many teams.  

Still, students in ThoughtSTEM classes are naturally presented with many opportunities for leadership.  Ambitious student who wish to grow as @Leaders more quickly can be encouraged to seek out more such opportunities, actively guiding the growth of their @leadership skills.

@subsection{Assesesment Benchmarks}

Historically, coding education has focused exclusinvely on coding.  In a few short decades since the rise of the internet, however, the discipline of software development has become intensely collaborative -- with greater and greater communication expectations placed on working programmers.  This has left education in a tricky position -- where many educators (even at the college level) are literally training students for the wrong job.   

The root of the problem is that many teachers and students erroneously believe that their goal is to create @Coders that look like this: 

@(skill-plot (report (bad-expert-coder)))

This is the ficticious assessment of a supposedly "expert" coder -- who knows one language well, but who has no formal training in any other skills.  There are two major problems with this instructional philosophy:

@itemize[
  @item{@bold{First, it's inefficient.}  There's a wealth of scientific research that shows that people, across almost every field of study, learn faster when they learn to communicate, collaborate, lead, and teach.  (The National Research Council's report "How People Learn" is a fantastic resource on the subject of how the science of how people learn can be leveraged to design better educational environments.)}
  @item{@bold{Second, it's immoral.}  Attempting to train students in this way hurts them and everyone they will ever work with for the rest of their careers (until they finally, hopefully acquire the skills on their own).  It stunts cognitive growth and is terrible for the economy.  Collaborative skills are simply too important to withhold.  The same is true for is the ability to learn and master many languages, not just one.}
]

Depending on the age of the student, our expectations are different -- but the fundamental philosophy is the same: To train @Expert @Coders, @Communicators, @Collaborators, @Leaders, @Teachers, and @Architects .

@subsection{Expectations: Kindergarten through 2nd Grade}

@margin-note{
  @bold{Disclaimer:} These are our minimum expectations.  Many students can and do surpass the minimum skill levels discussed here.
}

@margin-note{
  @bold{Disclaimer:} The estimation of "1 year" assumes that students have been taking ThoughtSTEM classes and camps for a year -- with minimal work outside of class.
}

For example, a student who begins in Kindergarten and trains for one year is expected to have the following levels:

@(skill-plot (report (k-2-year-1)))

After another year, we expect students to have mastered additional languages and continued to gain @Expertise as @Coder / @Communicators .

@(skill-plot (report (k-2-year-2)))

Finally, after another year, we expect students to have mastered additional languages and closed the gap between their @Collaborator skills and their @Communicator skills.

@(skill-plot (report (k-2-year-3)))

We can see the expected trend for the above hypothetical student better if we compare all three years on one chart:

@(compare-k-2-years)

@subsection{Expections: 3rd through 5th Grade}

@margin-note{
  @bold{Disclaimer:} These are our minimum expectations.  Many students can and do surpass the minimum skill levels discussed here.

For 3rd through 5th graders, we expect that they will learn faster, and that they will have achieved sufficient cognitive development to be able to focus on higher level coding skills.

3rd grade:

@(skill-plot (report (3rd-5th-year-1)))

4th grade:

@(skill-plot (report (3rd-5th-year-2)))

5th grade:

@(skill-plot (report (3rd-5th-year-3)))

Comparision across all three years:

@(compare-3rd-5th-years)

@subsection{Expectations: 6th through 8th grade}

}

At the 6th through 8th grade level, we expect significantly more growth as @Leaders and @Teachers, as well as greater overall growth at the end of the three years.

6th grade:

@(skill-plot (report (6th-8th-year-1)))

7th grade:

@(skill-plot (report (6th-8th-year-2)))

8th grade:

@(skill-plot (report (6th-8th-year-3)))

Comparison across three years:

@(compare-6th-8th-years) 

@subsection{Expectations: 9th through 12th grade}

At the 8th through 12th grade level, we expect significantly more growth as @Leaders and @Teachers, and moderate growth as an @Architect .  We also expect greater overall growth after 4 years.

9th grade:

@(skill-plot (report (9th-12th-year-1)))

10th grade:

@(skill-plot (report (9th-12th-year-2)))

11th grade:
@(skill-plot (report (9th-12th-year-3)))

11th grade:
@(skill-plot (report (9th-12th-year-4)))

Comparison across all 4 years:
@(compare-9th-12th-years) 

@subsection{Comparisons across ages}

This section slices the data from the previous sections differently.  It shows how our expectations how students that begin at different ages will progress.

Beginners' skills after 1 year are expected to look as follows, depending on the age of the student:

@(compare-first-years)

Beginners' skills after 2 years are expected to look as follows, depending on the age of the student:

@(compare-second-years)

Beginners' skills after 3 years are expected to look as follows, depending on the age of the student:

@(compare-third-years)
