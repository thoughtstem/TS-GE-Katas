@section{Schedule Breakdown}

Here is some detailed information on how each block of time on the
schedule above is expected to run. But first:

@subsection{Day Differences}

As you see on the visual schedule above, the schedules for Monday, Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday,
and Friday are all slightly different. The reasons for this are straightforward:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item{Additional time for check-in is allowed on Monday, since
                all students and staff will stay at the pick up location until 9:15
                on the first day.}
          @item{Also, the first activities are icebreakers, for obvious reasons!}
          @item{For Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, these extra 15 minutes go into
                game time.}
          @item{On Friday there is GAME JAM! The last hour and a half are spent on
                this.}]

@subsection{Check-in}

@bold[@larger{8:45am - 9:00/9:15am}]

It is important to start check-in on time, @bold{but not early!} On the first day,
all staff and students stay at the pick up location until all students arrive, or
9:15am -- whichever comes first. All other days, all students and the majority of
staff go to the camp room at 9am, and one Team Leader will stay at the pick up
location until all students have arrived or 9:15 -- whichever comes first.

In most locations, parents should be staying in their cars during drop off.The
one exception to this rule is on Day One: when parents need to stay with their
student until the Head Coach confirms that ThoughtSTEM has all paperwork required.

To run a smooth and successful check-in, each coach should take over a specific
job in the check in process:

@bold[@larger{Head Coach}]

The Head Coach duties during check-in are:
@itemlist[@item{Assign jobs to Team Leaders, adjust jobs as needed}
          @item{Check students in as they arrive on ThoughtSTEM backend,
                using tablet}
          @item{Answer parent questions or direct parents to contact HQ}
          @item{Oversee the check-in process to ensure safety and sanity}]

@bold[@larger{1-2 Team Leaders -- Home Base Managers}]

These TLs hang out with the students who have already been dropped off.
Duties include:
@itemlist[@item{Keeping all students in our care together and safe}
          @item{Interrupting and redirecting unsafe student behavior
                (ex. wandering off, playing with sticks, throwing rocks, etc)}
          @item["Fostering a comfortable, welcoming environment by talking to
                students, starting conversations between students and going
                out of their way to engage students on the fringe."
                @bold{This is especially important on day one!}]]

@bold[@larger{1-2 Team Leaders -- Kiddo Collectors}]

These TLs move between cars, completing the following duties:
@itemlist[@item{Ensuring student safety around cars}
          @item{directing them (or in some cases, walking them) to where the rest
                of the students are, with HB Managers}
          @item{Checking in with parents, answering any quick questions and calling
                over the Head Coach to deal with any more complex questions}
          @item{Helping Head Coach keep track of all arriving students and correctly
                check them in.}]

@bold[@larger{1 Team Leader -- Traffic Cop}]

This TL helps keep the car chaos to a minimum. Duties include:
@itemlist[@item{Ensuring student safety around cars}
          @item{Keeping the car line moving forward}
          @item{Helping parents navigate out safely}
          @item{Reminding parents they they should stay in cars, or, helping them
                find a place to park on a rare occasion where they need to get out
                of the car}]

@bold[@larger{If Needed: 1-2 Team Leaders -- Complete Set Up}]

If 8:45 arrives and there is more setup to complete, the Head Coach can assign one
or two TLs to stay in the camp room and finish up.

@bold[@larger{Special Location Instructions}]

Some of our camp locations have different check-in proceedures. In some cases, we
are part of a larger camp where the main staff handles check-in. Others require
slightly different jobs:

@bold{Fleet Science Center}

@itemlist[@item{On first day check in, Head Coach needs to confirm the authorized
                pick up list with each parent/guardian as they drop off their
                student.}
          @item{There also may be additional paperwork to hand out to parents.}
          @item{Team Leader Assignments -- Kiddo Collectors and Traffic
                Cop may shift to assist Head Coach or to HB Managers.}]

@bold{Del Mar Unified School District}
???

@bold{Lawrence Family JCC}
Students are part of a larger camp and will be brought to your room by counselors.
Attendance is still required.
