@section{Schedule Breakdown}

Here is some detailed information on how each block of time on the
schedule above is expected to run. But first:

@subsection{Day Differences}

As you see on the visual schedule above, the schedules for Monday, Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday,
and Friday are all slightly different. The reasons for this are straightforward:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item{Additional time for check-in is allowed on Monday, since
                all students and staff will stay at the pick up location until 9:15
                on the first day.}
          @item{Also, the first activities are icebreakers, for obvious reasons!}
          @item{For Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, these extra 15 minutes go into
                game time.}
          @item{On Friday there is GAME JAM! The last hour and a half are spent on
                this.}]

@subsection{Check-in}

@bold[@larger{MON 8:45am - 9:15am & TUE-FRI 8:45am - 9:00am}]

It is important to start check-in on time, @bold{but not early!} On the first day,
all staff and students stay at the pick up location until all students arrive, or
9:15am -- whichever comes first. All other days, all students and the majority of
staff go to the camp room at 9am, and one Team Leader will stay at the pick up
location until all students have arrived or 9:15 -- whichever comes first.

In most locations, parents should be staying in their cars during drop off.The
one exception to this rule is on Day One: when parents need to stay with their
student until the Head Coach confirms that ThoughtSTEM has all paperwork required.

To run a smooth and successful check-in, each coach should take over a specific
job in the check in process:

@bold[@larger{Head Coach}]

The Head Coach duties during check-in are:
@itemlist[@item{Assign jobs to Team Leaders, adjust jobs as needed}
          @item{Check students in as they arrive on ThoughtSTEM backend,
                using tablet}
          @item{Answer parent questions or direct parents to contact HQ}
          @item{Oversee the check-in process to ensure safety and sanity}]

@bold[@larger{Home Base Managers -- 1-2 Team Leaders}]

These TLs hang out with the students who have already been dropped off.
Duties include:
@itemlist[@item{Keeping all students in our care together and safe}
          @item{Interrupting and redirecting unsafe student behavior
                (ex. wandering off, playing with sticks, throwing rocks, etc)}
          @item["Fostering a comfortable, welcoming environment by talking to
                students, starting conversations between students and going
                out of their way to engage students on the fringe."
                @bold{This is especially important on day one!}]]

@bold[@larger{Kiddo Collectors -- 1-2 Team Leaders}]

These TLs move between cars, completing the following duties:
@itemlist[@item{Ensuring student safety around cars}
          @item{directing them (or in some cases, walking them) to where the rest
                of the students are, with HB Managers}
          @item{Checking in with parents, answering any quick questions and calling
                over the Head Coach to deal with any more complex questions}
          @item{Helping Head Coach keep track of all arriving students and correctly
                check them in.}]

@bold[@larger{Traffic Cop -- 1 Team Leader}]

This TL helps keep the car chaos to a minimum. Duties include:
@itemlist[@item{Ensuring student safety around cars}
          @item{Keeping the car line moving forward}
          @item{Helping parents navigate out safely}
          @item{Reminding parents they they should stay in cars, or, helping them
                find a place to park on a rare occasion where they need to get out
                of the car}]

@bold[@larger{If Needed: 1-2 Team Leaders -- Complete Set Up}]

If 8:45 arrives and there is more setup to complete, the Head Coach can assign one
or two TLs to stay in the camp room and finish up.

@bold[@larger{Special Location Instructions}]

Some of our camp locations have different check-in proceedures. In some cases, we
are part of a larger camp where the main staff handles check-in. Others require
slightly different jobs:

@bold{Fleet Science Center}

@itemlist[@item{On first day check in, Head Coach needs to confirm the authorized
                pick up list with each parent/guardian as they drop off their
                student.}
          @item{There also may be additional paperwork to hand out to parents.}
          @item{Team Leader Assignments -- Kiddo Collectors and Traffic
                Cop may shift to assist Head Coach or to HB Managers.}]

@bold{Del Mar Unified School District}

All students are brought to the camp room, either by the parent or the early child
care counselors.

@bold{Lawrence Family JCC}

Students are part of a larger camp and will be brought to your room by counselors.
Attendance is still required.


@subsection{Icebreakers}
@bold[@larger{MON 9:15am - 9:30am}]

The first activity upon arriving to the classroom should be getting to know the
students and giving them a chance to get to know you! @bold{EXCITING ENERGY} is
vital for this activity.

Icebreakers should be led by the Head Coach, and all Team Leaders should
participate.

Choose one or two of the Icebreaker games in the section below-- or play your own
favorite get-to-know-you game!

@bold{LINK TO ICEBREAKER GAMES HERE????}

@subsection{Coding Warmup}
@bold[@larger{TUE-FRI 9:00am - 9:15am}]

A chance for students to settle in, try katas from yesterday, test combining
katas, etc while the Teaching Team settles in as well. Fairly independant time,
since at least 1 Team Leader may still be at the pick-up/drop-off location. TLs
and the Head Coach may want to give out specific challenges with goals and TS
Dollar rewards to keep students on task.

@subsection{Intro & Starter Katas}
@bold[@larger{MON 9:30am - 10:15am}]

Head Coach leads into this section by explaining a few core concepts:
@itemlist[@item{GAME JAM!}
          @item{Katas}
          @item{Kata cards, ThoughtSTEM Dollars & Market}]

Head Coach also leads camp in earning their very first Kata -- the Core Values
Kata. Once all students have earned the kata (HC and Team Leaders working
together to award kata card hole punches and dollars), HC hands it over the the
TLs, who start their team on the first kata section. See more details on
teaching katas below:

@subsection{Katas}
@bold[@larger{TUE-FRI 9:15am - 10:00am}]

Breakout time when each camp is working independently with their Team Leader to
learn and earn katas in their curriculum. Here's how to optimize the LEARNING as
well as the FUN:

@itemlist[@item[@bold{Mix Up Tactics} " -- Be intentional in choosing tactics.
                Don't be afraid to try something new!"]
          @item[@bold{Quality over Quantity} " -- It is more important that the
                students actually earn the katas than get through any specific
                number of katas. To earn a kata, a student must be able to
                code the response to the given stimuli without hints. This does
                require repetition and practice to achieve a mix of memorization
                and comprehension. Just like learning a new language!"]
          @item[@bold{Don't Over Do It!} " -- Resist the temptation to 'just
                finish this one kata...' and stretch over the 45 minute time
                block. In addition to students and TLs needing a break, getting
                off schedule adds extra stress of needing to catch up and cut
                time from other activities."]]

Head Coach is working the whole classroom; checking in, offering advice and
encouragement, helping with any especially tricky bugs and assisting in behavior
management when needed.

@subsection{Snack Break}
@bold[@larger{MON 10:15am - 10:30am & TUE-FRI 10:00am - 10:15am}]

This is @bold{Team Leader Break Time} as well. Head Coach should manage the
camp while TLs @bold{leave the camp room} and take a 15 minute break. If the HC
cannot fully focus on the entire camp for whatever reason (debugging the computers,
handling behavior issues), there is also the option to keep some or all TLs
during snack, and they can take their break during Game Time.

For the students, this is @bold{unstructured} break time. These are great times
for students to take a break from the computers, snack and relax! However,
@bold{even in unstructured time, staff should always be aware of, and in control of
the camp environment}. Remember:

@itemlist[@item[@bold{During breaks, all students are OFF our computers.}
                " This can be a hard rule to enforce all the time -- what
                about the student who wants to keep coding, that's good
                right? Or the student who is a bit behind, and wants to spend
                break catching up? What if they are just playing their game?
                But really. " @larger{Really.} " Please make sure all students
                are completely off the computers during all breaks. Among
                other things, time away from the computer allows for students
                to get back in touch with those annoying physical bodies we
                have -- and sometimes it's not until they step away
                from the screen that they realize 'Oh! I'm hungry/thirsty/sore/need
                to go to the bathroom!' " 
                @bold{This is a ThoughtSTEM Camp policy and needs to be followed!}]
          @item[@bold{Keep it sane and safe.} " HC can (and should!) give the
                students some space during these breaks, but must stay attentive
                for student safety. There shouldn't be running or throwing things. 
                HC should also be mindful of conversations -- keeping an ear
                out for topics that could upset or seem inappropriate to other
                students. " @bold{Per ThoughtSTEM Policy, student phones and other
                           tech should remain off in student bags through all of camp,
                           breaks included.}]
          @item[@bold{Be mindful of ALL students.} " Just like during the rest of
                camp, HC is working to make this as positive of an experience
                for each student as possible! To this end," @bold{watch for lonely kiddos}
                ". Do your best to make every student feel welcomed, even it if means
                you just sit with that quiet student and chat about Spiderman for a
                few minutes."]]

@subsection{Game Time}
@bold[@larger{MON 10:30am - 10:45am & TUE-FRI 10:00am - 10:15am}]

Why Game Time? Social games can help students...
@itemlist[@item{...release excess energy!}
          @item{...take a brain break from coding!}
          @item{...socialize, especially if they are shy!}
          @item{...feel like they are getting a "real camp experience!"}
          @item{...engage and connect with staff and other students!}
          @item{...remember who the staff are and how to listen to them!}]

The Head Coach Script has a game recommendation for each day. HCs are welcome to
make adjustments to serve their specific group of students, keeping the following
guidelines in mind:
@itemlist[@item{Whenever possible, play a game that is accessible for the youngest
                campers while still being engaging for the oldest!}
          @item{HC can also split the camp into two groups to play two different
                games to help shrink the accessible/engaging age gap.}
          @item{While it can be tempting to stick with one game that entertains,
                it can be worthwhile to try new things too!}]
