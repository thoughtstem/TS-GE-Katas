Here is some detailed information on how each block of time on the
schedule above is expected to run.

@subsection{Check-in & Welcome}

@bold[@larger{8:45am - 9:15am}]

It is important to start check-in on time, but not early! To run a
smooth and successful check-in, each coach should take over a specific
job in the check in process.

AT FLEET: The Jobs for coaches to take on are listed below. Jobs are
listed from most to least vital, so fill in the top jobs first
if you have fewer than 5 coaches:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item[@bold{Check-in Coach}
                " -- armed with roster and any parent handouts, check-in each student:"
                @itemlist[@item{Check paperwork status, give any needed paperwork to parent}
                          @item{Ask parent to confirm authorized pick-up list}
                          @item{Give parent any handouts}
                          @item{Check student in and send into room}]]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach}
                " -- as students arrive, welcome them to class:"
                @itemlist[@item{Explain and make name tags}
                          @item{Be sure to check photo permission for each student!}
                          @item{Show where lunches/bags can be set}
                          @item{If no other Welcome Coaches, take on some of the responsibilities of Welcome Coach 2 as well}]]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach 2}
                " -- make a comfortable environment for students while waiting for the day to officially start:"
                @itemlist[@item{Encourage conversation between students}
                          @item{Notice any shy/uncomfortable students and include them}
                          @item{Small talk or games, just keep is comfortable and welcoming!}]]
          @item[@bold{Check-in Coach 2}
                " -- assist with check in: answering parent questions, handout paperwork, etc."]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach 3}
                " -- same as Welcome 2."]
          ]

@subsection{Introduction & Teams}

@bold[@larger{9:15am* - 9:45am}]

*Start when all students have arrived or 9:15; whichever comes first.

@bold{Introduction}
-- gather all students and outline the day, being sure to explain
(with the help of any returning students):

@itemlist[@item{GAME JAM (briefly, more detail later)}
          @item{What kind of game you are making today}
          @item{Katas, kata cards (name tags), and table rotation}
          @item{ThoughtSTEM dollars and market}
          @item{Core Values}]

@bold{Making Teams}
-- break the students into teams. They can choose their teams with
coach assistance to make sure teams are balanced and happy! Students
work together to create a team name and add it to the Daily Team Sheet.

Number of teams depends of the size of the camp and number of coaches.
You will never have more teams than coaches, but you may have fewer.
Use the guide below to assist:

@itemlist[@item{>7 students = no more than 1 team}
          @item{7 - 11 students = no more than 2 teams} 
          @item{12 - 15 students = no more than 3 teams}
          @item{16 - 19 students = no more than 4 teams}
          @item{20+ students = no more than 5 teams}]

@subsection{Intro Katas & First Kata Rotation}

@bold[@larger{9:45am - 10:15am}]

Each team is directed to a table with a coach. That coach leads the
students through the @bold{Intro Katas} and as many of the @bold{First Katas}
as their team earns in the 30 minute block. First Katas are almost
always the avatar/avatar-equivalent katas, but will always be labeled
as well.

This is the only kata block where everyone is working on the same
katas. See below for more guidelines.

@subsection{Kata Rotations}

@bold[@larger{10:15am - 10:45am}]

@bold[@larger{11:15am - 11:45am}]

@bold[@larger{1:00pm - 1:30pm}]

@bold[@larger{1:30pm - 2:00pm}]

This is the foundation of the educational part of camp. Here's how to
optimize the LEARNING as well as the FUN!

@bold{Rotate tables and coaches} -- mixing things up has many benefits
for students (different coaches have different teaching styles, time to
stand and stretch, change in space helps wake up tired brains...) as well
as for coaches (taking turns with more challenging students, students
keep changing computers and can't get attached to code, coaches can focus
on knowing one set of katas).

@bold{No minimum goal} -- don't stress about getting through a certain
number of katas with any given team. It is more important that the students
actually earn the katas than get through any specific number of katas.

@bold{Kata cards} -- For every kata earned, students receive
a new hole punch in their kata card. Once they have filled their card,
students can get a ThoughtSTEM Dollar bonus! Then they keep that card,
and start working on a new one.

@bold{Stick to 30 min max!} -- make sure you have time for non-computer
breaks and, of course, GAME JAM!

@subsection{Snack Break}

@bold[@larger{10:45am - 10:55am}]

This is @bold{unstructured} break time. These are great times for students 
to take a break from the computers, snack and relax! However, @bold{even in
unstructured time, coaches should always be aware of, and in control of
the camp environment}. Remember:

@itemlist[@item[@bold{During breaks, all students are OFF our computers.}
                " This can be a hard rule to enforce all the time -- what
                about the student who wants to keep coding, that's good
                right? Or the student who is a bit behind, and wants to spend
                break catching up? What if they are just playing their game?
                But really. " @larger{Really.} " Please make sure all students
                are completely off the computers during all breaks. Among
                other things, time away from the computer allows for students
                to get back in touch with those annoying physical bodies we
                have -- and sometimes it's not until they step away
                from the screen that they realize 'Oh! I'm hungry/thirsty/sore/need
                to go to the bathroom!' " 
                @bold{This is a ThoughtSTEM Camp policy and needs to be followed!}]
          @item[@bold{Keep it sane and safe.} " Coaches can (and should!) give the
                students some space during these breaks, but must stay attentive
                for student safety. There shouldn't be running or throwing things. 
                Coaches should also be mindful of conversations -- keeping an ear
                out for topics that could upset or seem inappropriate to other
                students. Be especially mindful of students
                using their own devices (phones and computers) during breaks. While
                not strictly disallowed, that privilege can be removed at anytime."]
          @item[@bold{Be mindful of ALL students.} " Just like during the rest of
                camp, coaches are working to make this as positive of an experience
                for each student as possible! To this end," @bold{watch for lonely kiddos}
                ". Do your best to make every student feel welcomed, even it if means
                you just sit with that quiet student and chat about Spiderman for a
                few minutes."]]

@subsection{Game Breaks}

@bold[@larger{10:55am - 11:15am}]

@bold[@larger{2:00pm - 2:20pm}]

Game breaks may be substitutes with unstructured time, if needed, or (if at Fleet)
museum time. However, games are recommended because of the benefits that playing social
games can have for students (and coaches!):

Social games can help students...
@itemlist[@item{...release excess energy!}
          @item{...take a brain break from coding!}
          @item{...socialize, especially if they are shy!}
          @item{...feel like they are getting a "real camp experience!"}
          @item{...engage and connect with coaches and other students!}
          @item{...remember who the leaders are (coaches) and how to listen to them!}]

Coaches are encouraged to play any games they think will engage the students! You can
also find a list of games specifically curated for ThoughtSTEM camps here:
@hyperlink["http://www.tinyurl.com/ts-game-list" "www.tinyurl.com/ts-game-list"].

Students do not have to participate. Coaches should strive for 100% participation, which
may involve some creative rule adjustments for students with differing needs and abilities!
If a student will not play, and refuses accomodation, that student may sit
quietly to the side with a coach. Remember -- if sitting out becomes more attractive than
the game you are playing (the student gets to play on their phone, for example), you will
be fighting an uphill battle to get even 50% participation!

@bold{Remember: no students should be on computers during breaks}. This rule also should
extend to the student's own devices (phones, computers) during structured breaks such as
game breaks.

@subsection{Transition to Lunch/Buffer Time}

@bold[@larger{11:45am - 12:00pm}]

Time that can be be eaten into if any of the morning activities run over. Otherwise
you can fill this time with any tidying up that is needed, a quick game, bank time
(when students can exchange 1s for 5s, etc), or even market!

@subsection{Coach Lunch Breaks}

Every coach gets at least 30 min break for lunch.

AT FLEET: Coaches split into 2 groups and take breaks in alternating shifts.
When not on lunch, coaches are assisting Fleet staff with monitoring student
lunch. Lunch breaks are either from 12:00pm - 12:30pm or 12:30pm - 1:00pm.
@bold{Be sure to take your entire break and also return on time so the rest 
of your team can have their entire break!}

@subsection{Transition into Game Jam}

@bold[@larger{2:20pm - 2:30pm}]

After your game break (it is important to take a break between last kata rotation
and the game jam!), take some time to outline some specifics of game jam and get the
students excited and ready!

@bold{To review prior to game jam:}
@itemlist[@item["Coaches are now " @bold{judges} ", so don't expect us to help you out (for free)!"]
          @item["The way to succeed in game jam is to " @bold{start small} " and "
                @bold{test often.} " Once more for the kids in the back! "
                @bold[@larger{Start small and test often!!!}]]
          @item[@bold{Points} " are awarded in two ways:"
                @itemlist[@item{throughout the game jam with bonus point stickers for CREATIVITY or COOPERATION}
                          @item{at the end based on number of parentheses and keywords}]]
          @item["Careful though, "@bold{you don't get any points if your game doesn't run!}
                " Hence the first bit of advice! Coaches will help all students make sure
                their games do run, but we don't need to tell them that at the top!"]
          @item["At the end of the jam, students will calculate their points and earn "
                @bold{ThoughtSTEM Dollars} " to be used in the market!"]
          @item[@bold{Score Cards!} "Hand out index cards, have students write their
                name and their team name. Explain that Bonus Stickers will go here."]
          @item["Take the time to explain any " @bold{Student Supports} " that will be
                available during the jam. See Below for more info on Student Supports."]
          @item[@bold{Pair up} " if you are running game jam in pairs!"]
          @item["Reinforce other rules, like no touching other people's computers, no running
                or anything else you deem necessary"]]

Just as important as any rules/reminders is setting the right energy for the jam! Be @bold{positive},
@bold{excited}, and @bold{focused}!

@subsection{GAME JAM!}

@bold[@larger{2:30pm - 3:30pm}]

Here's some advice on how to create a fun and successful jam!

@bold[@larger{Student Support}]

We know that asking students to code an entire game with code they have only learned that day can be
daunting! There are lots of support systems you can add to ensure student success while still
encouraging independence and creativity:

@itemlist[@item[@bold{Resource Center} " -- set up a couple computers with access to the katas.thoughtstem.com 
                page. Show students how to navigate the page prior to game jam. Computers MUST STAY at the
                center, and coaches may instate a price for visiting the Resource Center at any time!"]
          @item[@bold{Call in a Coach!} " -- this is an easy thing to add partway though a jam if you are
                seeing frustrated students. For a fee, any student can get a coaches help for 2 minutes! A
                good starting price is 5 ThoughtSTEM Dollars."]
          @item[@bold{Starting Code} " -- don't forget that you always have access to scrap paper, white board
                or any other tools where you can write hints for some or all students."]]

@bold{A word of advice:} Err on the side of fewer supports -- the students may surprise you! You can always add
some supports in partway through jam, but it's harder to take them away!

@bold[@larger{Coaches}]

Okay, the jam is on. What do you, a coach, do now??

@itemlist[@item["Encourage the kids by " @bold{awarding bonus point stickers} " when they do things we like
                to see! When they work with their team, when they test their game, when they create a cool
                story behind their game, etc. Also use the stickers as a motivator when things get tough:
                'bonus point for working on debugging! That's tricky stuff!' Not all students/teams need
                to get the saem number of bonus, but keep an eye on distibution to keep it fair."]
          @item["Monitor how students are progressing, and " @bold{adjust jam rules} " to make it easier or
                harder as needed! For example, adding a price to the resource center, or adding in the ability
                to Call in a Coach!"]
          @item["In general, be a positive and supportive presence! BE EXCITED!"]]


@bold[@larger{Scoring & Awarding}]

Be sure to stop game jam with enough time to tally points! Students should score their own games, under the
guidance and review of coaches. The suggested point algorithm is below, but should be adjusted to make sure
students earn enough money to feel accomplished without bankrupting the coaches! Aiming for $10-25 is
good sweet-spot.

@racketblock[
 (num of open parentheses) + (num of close parentheses) + (num of keywords, ex. #:avatar) = X

 X/5 = Y

 Y + (num of bonus point stickers) = TOTAL $$]


@subsection{Market}

@bold[@larger{3:30pm - 3:45pm}]

Do your best to keep the market organized and yourselves sane! Some hints on how to accomplish this:

@itemlist[@item{Dismiss teams one at a time to the market.}
          @item{Do not dismiss a team until they have completed any clean up tasks you have given
           them.}
          @item{Give yourself enough time for market -- don't make yourself rush!}]


@subsection{Check Out}

@bold[@larger{3:45pm - 4:15pm}]

Just like with check-in, splitting up what needs to be done between the coaches will keep things
safe, sane and easy!

FOR FLEET -- Recommended jobs are listed below, in order of most to least important:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item[@bold{Dismissal Coach}
                " -- armed with roster, check the IDs of every student pick-up:"
                @itemlist[@item{Move down the line of cars, checking for anyone picking up a student from our camp}
                          @item{(Sometimes people will park and walk up to you as well)}
                          @item{Ask for student name, and to see ID}
                          @item{Check ID against approved pick up list}
                          @item{If name is on list -- go get student or send Runner Coach}
                          @item{If name is not on list -- check in with Andia and  either call parent yourself or Fleet will call}]]
          @item[@bold{Classroom Coach}
                " -- stay in the room with students:"
                @itemlist[@item{Keep students safe and happy!}
                          @item{Help Dismissal or Runner Coach get students have a pickup waiting}
                          @item{If possible, start minor tidying and clean up.}]]
          @item[@bold{Runner Coach}
                " -- bring students from classroom to their waiting pickup:"
                @itemlist[@item{Wait for the OK from the Dismissal Coach}
                          @item{Make sure students get safely to their car}]]
          @item[@bold{Runner Coach 2}
                " -- same as Runner Coach."]
          @item[@bold{Classroom Coach 2}
                " -- same as Classroom Coach."]
          ]

If any students are left at 4:15, let the monitors know through Slack, and Andia at Fleet.
