Here is some detailed information on how each block of time on the
schedule above is expected to run.

@subsection{Check-in & Welcome}

@bold[@larger{8:45am - 9:15am}]

It is important to start check-in on time, but not early!

Each Coach should have one of the following specific jobs. Jobs are
listed below from most to least vital, so fill in the top jobs first
if you have fewer than 5 coaches:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item[@bold{Check-in Coach}
                "-- armed with roster and any parent handouts, check-in each student:"
                @itemlist[@item{Check paperwork status, give any needed paperwork to parent}
                          @item{Ask parent to confirm authorized pick-up list}
                          @item{Give parent any handouts}
                          @item{Check student in and send into room}]]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach}
                "-- as students arrive, welcome them to class:"
                @itemlist[@item{Explain and make name tags}
                          @item{Show where lunches/bags can be set}
                          @item{If no other Welcome Coaches, take on some of the responsibilities of Welcome Coach 2 as well}]]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach 2}
                "-- make a comfortable environment for students while waiting for the day to officially start:"
                @itemlist[@item{Encourage conversation between students}
                          @item{Notice any shy/uncomfortable students and include them}
                          @item{Small talk or games, just keep is comfortable and welcoming!}]]
          @item[@bold{Check-in Coach 2}
                "-- assist with check in: answering parent questions, handout paperwork, etc."]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach 3}
                "-- same as Welcome 2."]
          ]

@subsection{Introduction & Teams}

@bold[@larger{9:15am* - 9:45am}]

*Start when all students have arrived or 9:15; whichever comes first.

@bold{Introduction}
-- gather all students and outline the day, being sure to explain
(with the help of any returning students):

@itemlist[@item{GAME JAM (briefly, more detail later)}
          @item{What kind of game you are making today}
          @item{Katas, health bars (name tags), and table rotation}
          @item{ThoughtSTEM dollars and market}
          @item{Core Values}]

@bold{Making Teams}
-- break the students into teams. They can choose their teams with
coach assistance to make sure teams are balanced and happy! Students
work together to create a team name and add it to the Daily Team Sheet.

Number of teams depends of the size of the camp and number of coaches.
You will never have more teams than coaches, but you may have fewer.
Use the guide below to assist:

@itemlist[@item{>7 students = no more than 1 team}
          @item{7 - 11 students = no more than 2 teams} 
          @item{12 - 15 students = no more than 3 teams}
          @item{16 - 19 students = no more than 4 teams}
          @item{20+ students = no more than 5 teams}]

@subsection{Intro Katas & First Kata Rotation}

@bold[@larger{9:45am - 10:15am}]

Each team is directed to a table with a coach. That coach leads the
students through the @bold{Intro Katas} and as many of the @bold{First Katas}
as their team earns in the 30 minute block. First Katas are almost
always the avatar/avatar-equivalent katas, but will always be labeled
as well.

This is the only kata block where everyone is working on the same
katas. See below for more guidelines.

@subsection{Kata Rotations}

@bold[@larger{10:15am - 10:45am}]

@bold[@larger{11:15am - 11:45am}]

@bold[@larger{1:00pm - 1:30pm}]

@bold[@larger{1:30pm - 2:00pm}]

This is the foundation of the educational part of camp. Here's how to
optimize the LEARNING as well as the FUN!

@bold{Rotate tables and coaches} -- mixing things up has many benefits
for students (different coaches have different teaching styles, time to
stand and stretch, change in space helps wake up tired brains...) as well
as for coaches (taking turns with more challenging students, students
keep changing computers and can't get attached to code, coaches can focus
on knowing on set of katas).

@bold{No minimum goal} -- don't stress about getting through a certain
number of katas with any given team. It is more important that the students
actually earn the katas than get through any specific number of katas.

@bold{Using the health bars} -- keep track of katas earned as follows:
@itemlist[@item{First earned -- fill in that table's block}
          @item{Second -- bonus sticker on that table's block}
          @item{Every other kata -- extra lives (heart stickers)!}]

@bold{Stick to 30 min max!} -- make sure you have time for non-computer
breaks and, of course, GAME JAM!

@subsection{Snack Break}

@bold[@larger{10:45am - 10:55am}]

This is @bold{unstructured} break time. These are great times for students 
to take a break from the computers, snack and relax! However, @bold{even in
unstructured time, coaches should always be aware of, and in control of
the camp environment}. Remember:

@itemlist[@item[@bold{During breaks, all students are OFF our computers.}
                " This can be a hard rule to enforce all the time -- what
                about the student who wants to keep coding, that's good
                right? Or the student who is a bit behind, and wants to spend
                break catching up? What if they are just playing their game?
                But really." @larger{Really.} "Please make sure all students
                are completely off the computers during all breaks. Among
                other things, time away from the computer allows for students
                to get back in touch with those annoying physical bodies we
                have -- and sometimes it's not until they step away
                from the screen that they realize 'Oh! I'm hungry/thirsty/
                sore/need to go to the bathroom!'"
                @bold{This is a ThoughtSTEM Camp policy and needs to be followed!}]
          @item[@bold{Keep it sane and safe.} " Coaches can (and should!) give the
                students some space during these breaks, but must stay attentive
                for student safety. There shouldn't be running or throwing things. 
                Coaches should also be mindful of conversations -- keeping an ear
                out for topics that could upset or seem inappropriate to other
                students. Coaches should be aware of what is happening in their
                camp at all times, even breaks. Be especially mindful of students
                using their own devices (phones and computers) during breaks. While
                not strictly disallowed, that privilege can be removed at anytime."]
          @item[@bold{Be mindful of ALL students.} " Just like during the rest of
                camp, coaches are working to make this as positive of an experience
                for each student as possible! To this end," @bold{watch for lonely kiddos}
                ". Do your best to make every student feel welcomed, even it if means
                you just sit with that quiet student and chat about Spiderman for a
                few minutes."]]

@subsection{Game Breaks}

@bold[@larger{10:55am - 11:15am}]

@bold[@larger{2:00pm - 2:20pm}]

Game breaks may be substitutes with unstructured time, if needed, or (if at Fleet)
museum time. However, games are recommended because of the benefits that playing social
games can have for students (and coaches!):

Social games can help students...
@itemlist[@item{...release excess energy!}
          @item{...take a brain break from coding!}
          @item{...socialize, especially if they are shy!}
          @item{...feel like they are getting a "real camp experience!"}
          @item{...engage and connect with coaches and other students!}
          @item{...remember who the leaders are (coaches) and how to listen to them!}]

Coaches are encouraged to play any games they think will engage the students! You can
also find a list of games specifically curated for ThoughtSTEM camps here:
@url{www.tinyurl.com/ts-game-list}.

Students do not have to participate. Coaches should strive for 100% participation, which
may involve some creative rule adjustments for students with differing needs and abilities!
If a student will not play, and refuses accomodation, that student may sit
quietly to the side with a coach. Remember -- if sitting out becomes more attractive than
the game you are playing (the student gets to play on their phone, for example), you will
be fighting an uphill battle to get even 50% participation!

@bold{Remember: no students should be on computers during breaks}. This rule also should
extend to the student's own devices (phones, computers) during structured breaks such as
game breaks.
