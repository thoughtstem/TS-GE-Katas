Here is some detailed information on how each block of time on the
schedule above is expected to run.

@subsection{Check-in & Welcome}

@bold[@larger{8:45am - 9:15am}]

It is important to start check-in on time, but not early!

Each Coach should have one of the following specific jobs. Jobs are
listed below from most to least vital, so fill in the top jobs first
if you have fewer than 5 coaches:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item[@bold{Check-in Coach}
                "-- armed with roster and any parent handouts, check-in each student:"
                @itemlist[@item{Check paperwork status, give any needed paperwork to parent}
                          @item{Ask parent to confirm authorized pick-up list}
                          @item{Give parent any handouts}
                          @item{Check student in and send into room}]]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach}
                "-- as students arrive, welcome them to class:"
                @itemlist[@item{Explain and make name tags}
                          @item{Show where lunches/bags can be set}
                          @item{If no other Welcome Coaches, take on some of the responsibilities of Welcome Coach 2 as well}]]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach 2}
                "-- make a comfortable environment for students while waiting for the day to officially start:"
                @itemlist[@item{Encourage conversation between students}
                          @item{Notice any shy/uncomfortable students and include them}
                          @item{Small talk or games, just keep is comfortable and welcoming!}]]
          @item[@bold{Check-in Coach 2}
                "-- assist with check in: answering parent questions, handout paperwork, etc."]
          @item[@bold{Welcome Coach 3}
                "-- same as Welcome 2."]
          ]

@subsection{Introduction & Teams}

@bold[@larger{9:15am* - 9:45am}]

*Start when all students have arrived or 9:15; whichever comes first.

@bold{Introduction}
-- gather all students and outline the day, being sure to explain
(with the help of any returning students):

@itemlist[@item{GAME JAM (briefly, more detail later)}
          @item{What kind of game you are making today}
          @item{Katas, health bars (name tags), and table rotation}
          @item{ThoughtSTEM dollars and market}
          @item{Core Values}]

@bold{Making Teams}
-- break the students into teams. They can choose their teams with
coach assistance to make sure teams are balanced and happy! Students
work together to create a team name and add it to the Daily Team Sheet.

Number of teams depends of the size of the camp and number of coaches.
You will never have more teams than coaches, but you may have fewer.
Use the guide below to assist:

@itemlist[@item{>7 students = no more than 1 team}
          @item{7 - 11 students = no more than 2 teams} 
          @item{12 - 15 students = no more than 3 teams}
          @item{16 - 19 students = no more than 4 teams}
          @item{20+ students = no more than 5 teams}]

@subsection{First Kata Rotation -- Avatar Katas}

@bold[@larger{9:45am - 10:15am}]

Each team is directed to a table with a coach. That coach leads the
students through as many of the Avatar Katas as their team earns in
the 30 minute block.

This is the only kata block where everyone is working on the same
katas. See below for more guidelines.

@subsection{Kata Rotations}

@bold[@larger{10:15am - 10:45am}]

@bold[@larger{11:15am - 11:45am}]

@bold[@larger{1:00pm - 1:30pm}]

@bold[@larger{1:30pm - 2:00pm}]

This is the foundation of the educational part of camp. Here's how to
optimize the LEARNING as well as the FUN!

@bold{Rotate tables and coaches} -- mixing things up has many benefits
for students (different coaches have different teaching styles, time to
stand and stretch, change in space helps wake up tired brains...) as well
as for coaches (taking turns with more challenging students, students
keep changing computers and can't get attached to code, coaches can focus
on knowing on set of katas).

@bold{No minimum goal} -- don't stress about getting through a certain
number of katas with any given team. It is more important that the students
actually earn the katas than get through any specific number of katas.

@bold{Using the health bars} -- keep track of katas earned as follows:
@itemlist[@item{First earned -- fill in that table's block}
          @item{Second -- bonus sticker on that table's block}
          @item{Every other kata -- extra lives (heart stickers)!}]

@bold{Stick to 30 min max!} -- make sure you have time for non-computer
breaks and, of course, GAME JAM!

@subsection{Snack Break}

@bold[@larger{10:45am - 10:55am}]

This is @bold{unstructured} break time. These are great times for students 
to take a break from the computers and relax
