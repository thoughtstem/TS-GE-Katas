@section{Game Jam Intro Video}

This introduction video outlines everything a student needs to know
before going into game jam, including:
@itemlist[@item{How to pair program}
          @item{How scoring works}
          @item{All about the resource center}]
It also can serve as a reminder to coaches on how game jam works!

@GAME-JAM-VID

Keep in mind that these are the minimum guidelines of a jam, and that
coaches can always add rules and student supports as they see fit.
