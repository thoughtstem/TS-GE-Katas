@title{Game Jam}

The goals of a Game Jam are simple:

@itemlist[@item["Game Jam is "  @bold{different and more exciting}
                " than a typical kata-earning day."]
          @item["Students " @bold{code a game} " from beginning to end."]
          @item["Students feel " @bold{proud and accomplished} " regarding
                what they did in Game Jam."]]

Rules of Game Jam can be adjusted to accommodate the needs of a particular batch of students,
as long as the goals above are still being served. Remember that adding support, hints
and assistance can make a potentially frustrating Game Jam into a success! However, adding
too much help can undermine a feeling of actual accomplishment. It's all about balance!

Coach energy is a big element in making this day different from others -- if @bold{you}
are excited, pumped, focused and wowed by student work, the students will follow!

@section{Game Jam for Different Age Groups}

Fundamentally, Game Jam is the same for any age.
However, differences in execution (especially for the K-2nd age group) are explained
in this doc. These changes help all students, regardless of age, achieve the goals above.

@section{Objective}

@larger{3rd-10th}

Build a working game, from scratch, using as many of the skills learned from katas and
other exercises plus additional resources available during Jam.

@larger{K-2nd}

Instead of working on one large game, K-2nd students work on individual challenge cards,
trying to build as many games back-to-back as they can!

@section{Partnering Up}

Working in pairs is recommended whenever possible -- two brains working on the same code
often leads to higher achievement! However, in smaller classes (like Summer Camps with
groups of 5) this doesn't always work. If you cannot make it mandatory, at least make it
an option! Here are some tips when pairing students up, whether you make it optional or
not:

@itemlist[@item{Give the students advance notice that they will be/might be working in
                pairs. This helps students who don't adjust to change very well.}
          @item{Practice pairing up at least once before the actual jam.}
          @item{You can pair up the students yourself if you think students may end up in
                distracting/unsuccessful partnerships or have difficulties settling into
                happy pairs. You can
                also let students pick their own partners and just help negotiate any
                disagreements as they arise.}
          @item{When leading into Game Jam, let student pick their partners/pair up the
                students yourself sooner rather
                than later -- they will be worrying about who they will end up with until
                its settled and won't be listening to a word you say until then!}
          @item{Have students switch "drivers" (who is typing) every 3 minutes. Set a
                timer and just keep running it, instructing students to swap every time it
                goes off.}
          @item{When students are paired up, they EACH receive the total dollars they
                earned with their game; they don't have to split the total between them.}]

@section{Prompt}

The challenge cards are the perfect prompt for Game Jam. Cards should stay stimulus-side-up
(code is hidden) unless the student "purchases" a card flip. Coaches should make it clear
that flipping a card over without paying up is cheating and keep an eye out as best they can
during the jam. Students will probably speak up @italic{very loudly} if they think they
see someone else breaking this rule. Offer reminders when needed, but only repercussions
when you see cheating with your own eyes.

@larger{3rd-10th}

Every student/pair of students is given three challenge cards as a starting prompt for
their game. @bold{These are optional!} If students have their own ideas of what they want
to create, go for it! The 3 card prompt is merely an inspiration to turn to if they get
stuck.

@larger{K-2nd}

A single challenge card is given to each student/pair of students. Once that challenge is
correctly completed, they receive their next challenge card!

Split the time of Game Jam between the two K-2 langs they have worked with -- spend the
first 15/20 minutes with the more basic language, then shift the students to the harder
lang after they finish the card they are working on, and move to those challenge cards!

@section{Hints and Help!}

Most students will need some sort of support to achieve the goals of Game Jam. During the
Jam, all coaches/staff are now @bold{judges} and will not be able to help students out (at
least not for free!). Instead, there are some standard resources available to the students
as well as some additional supports you can add if needed:

These are the standard resources that are a part of every Jam. Prices may be adjusted to
make it easier or harder to access, and, in turn, the Jam easier/harder!
@itemlist[@item[@bold{Challenge Cards} " -- the challenge cards are already on the table
                and the easiest assist available! If a student gets stuck, they may pay
                to flip their challenge card over to see the code for " @bold{5 ThoughtSTEM Dollars}
                ". Once they have purchased this flip, the card can stay code-up for the
                rest of the Jam. If you have multiple coaches working with the same
                students, keeping eachother up to date on any paid flips is advised, so
                no coaches accidentally reprimand a student for cheating when they aren't!"]
          @item[@bold{Asset Access} " -- free to all, where you can see all the
                assets/sprites available in the language you are Jammin' in! This can be
                a chromebook with the Asset Library page up on a separate table (must stay
                at this table), or a white board with the list of the identifiers, or a
                list projected up on a screen..."]]

Here are some additional supports that can be added during Game Jam. These can help if
students are struggling, without sacrificing the integrity of Game Jam:

@itemlist[@item[@bold{Call in a Coach!} " -- for " @bold{10 ThoughtSTEM dollars} ", any student can
                get a coach's help for 2 minutes! This can be very useful in the last 5
                or 10 minutes to get all student games running."]
          @item[@bold{Starting Code} " -- don't forget that you always have access to
                scrap paper, white board or any other tools where you can write hints for
                some or all students. A common reminder is the defining syntax, or basic
                code to start with."]]

@section{Staff Role During the Jam}

Okay, the jam is on. You are now a "judge." What does that mean? What do you do??

@itemlist[@item[@bold{Support the students} " by offering words of encouragement, advice on how to
                approach problems, and congratulations on cool code! Avoid the temptation
                to give answers to students when they are stuck, rather point them to the
                resources accessible to them."]
          @item["Encourage the kids by " @bold{awarding bonus point stickers} " (see Scoring Section)
                when they do things we like
                to see -- when they work with their team, when they test their game, when they create a cool
                story behind their game, etc! Also use the stickers as a motivator when things get tough:
                'bonus point for working on debugging! That's tricky stuff!' Not all students/teams need
                to get the same number of bonus, but keep an eye on distribution to keep it fair."]
          @item["Monitor how students are progressing, and " @bold{adjust jam rules} " to make it easier or
                harder as needed! For example, adding a price to the resource center, or adding in the ability
                to Call in a Coach!"]
          @item[@bold{Mediate any disagreements} " between partners or other students. This feels high-stakes
                for students, and tempers can flare on occasion. Be even-keeled and fair."]
          @item["In general, " @bold{be a positive and supportive presence!} " BE EXCITED!"]]

@section{Scoring}

Reward students bonus points throughout the Jam for CREATIVITY, COOPERATION and other
behaviors that you want to encourage! You can easily keep track of bonus points by giving
each student/pair of students an index card. Put a sticker on this index card every time
you award a point! This card can also come in handy when adding up points later.

At the end of Jam, students calculate their point total!
Points are only given for @bold{working games}! Coaches do whatever it takes to get every
student to have at least one working game. The suggested point algorithms are below,
but can be adjusted to make sure students earn enough money to feel accomplished without
bankrupting the coaches! $10-25 per student 
is a good sweet-spot (also think about how much money students SPENT in the Jam).

@larger{3rd-10th}

After the Jam time is up, students should score their own games, under the guidance and 
review of coaches. 

Scoring Step-by-Step:
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item{Make sure all games are running before awarding points!}
          @item{Count up total number of open and closed parens in code (each
                single paren counts as one). Write this number down.}
          @item{Count up total keywords in code. Write this number down.}
          @item{Add the previous two numbers together.}
          @item{Divide this number by five. (HINT: divide by less if average game is
                on the shorter side. Divide by more if games are longer.)}
          @item{Add on any additional bonus points.}
          @item{Give the ending number of dollars and Game Jam Badge to that student/each
                student in that pair!!!}]

Score Algorithm:
@racketblock[
 (((num of open parens)+(num of close parens)+(num of keywords, ex. #:avatar)) / 5)

   + (num of bonus point stickers) = TOTAL $$]

@larger{K-2nd}

K-2nd students will need a little more guidance in scoring, but should still participate
and help their coach!

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
          @item["Count up the total number of challenge cards each student/pair of student
                completed." @bold{ Keep track of these during the Jam with stickers on
                index cards!}]
          @item{If the average number is greater than 20 or so, divide this number by 2
                (see note about not bankrupting the coaches at the top of this section!).}
          @item{Add any additional bonus points earned.}
          @item{Give the ending number of dollars and Game Jam Badge to that student/each
                student in that pair!!!}]

@section{Leading into the Jam}

That was a lot of info! Now what do you tell the students??
Right before the Jam, the coach should review/explain what to expect with the students.
Be sure to hit the following points:

@itemlist[@item{How much time they have for the Jam.}
          @item{Scoring and Points! How they will earn points for their game, including
                bonus points. (don't forget to hand out cards!)}
          @item{Only get points for RUNNING games!}
          @item{Coaches are now Judges.}
          @item{The different resources and supports available (and how much they will
                cost ya!).}
          @item{Partner rules: swapping drivers, working as a team, etc.}
          @item{Reinforce other rules, like no touching other people's computers, no running
                or anything else you deem necessary}]

Offer this key piece of advice -- repeat it early and often:
@centered[@larger["The way to succeed in game jam is to " @bold{start small} " and "
          @bold{test often.} " Once more for the kids in the back! "
          @bold[@larger{Start small and test often!!!}]]]
