@section{Selfie Scavenger Hunt}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2, 3-5, 6-10}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{List of things to "find" (see below for examples)}
          @item{Large space to go hunt! Good to have clear, defined borders (a non-busy
                road, sports field, unique building -- big things you cannot miss)}
          @item{Each Team Leader should have their smart phone for this activity}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Head Coach facilitates breaking up into mixed age teams, as many as there are Team
Leaders. A "count off" from a circle (assign each student a number, put all 1's with this
TL, 2's with that TL, etc) or instructing them to find their OWN team consisting of one
member from each camp group -- either works!

Head Coach explains all these rules to everyone, before sending them on their hunt:
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Stick with your team! You cannot leave any members of your team behind.}
          @item{Explain the boundaries of the Search Area.}
          @item{Each team must take a group selfie with everything on the list.*}
          @item{Give a return time!}]

* If there is a no-photos student, make them the photographer, in charge of snapping the
shot of everyone else on their team and the object.

HC should reinforce a few key points with TLs -- the boundaries and return time
especially. HC can text or give a physical list of all the items to find to each TL.

As teams return, HC checks the photos; looking for every team member in each photos and
that they got everything on the list. Celebrate every team as they return!

@bold{EXAMPLE LISTS:}
Aim for 5-10 items on the list, depedning on how much time you are allowing for the hunt.
Leave some open ended items, where the thing to found might be different for everyone
(like "A Beautiful View") and include some riddles for extra fun!

Here were 2 seperate lists created for an old camp location at UCSD. Notes (not given to
teams!) are in italics:
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item["5 different things you can't do -- " @italic{There were lots of "no ___"

@itemlist[@item{Head Coach should keep an eye out for potential hunt items for the first

                with HQ so they can be passed on to future HCs!}]



@section{Duck Duck Goose}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle of all players, and space to run around the
                outside of the circle.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

You know how to play this game. Be safe!


@section{Follow the Leader}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Enough space for a circle of all players.}
          @item{A place for one student to go out of sight
                (ideally also out of hearing range) of the circle.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

One student is the "detective" and leaves the area (keep in mind, they need to be
accompanied but shouldn't be alone with an adult). The teacher picks one of the remaining
students to be the Leader. The Leader starts a simple movement (tapping head, clapping
hands, drumming fingers, etc) and the rest of the circle copies it. The Detective student
returns, and stands in the middle of the circle. Their job is to try and figure out who is
the Leader. Meanwhile, everyone is trying to follow the Leader as they change up the
movement, without giving away who the Leader is to the Detective. The round ends when the
Detective guesses correctly, or has three incorrect guesses.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[@item{May have to remind students not to directly stare at the Leader, but rather
                use their peripheral vision, or pay attention to someone else and match
                them!}]


@section{Shark Attack}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5, 6-10}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Scrap paper that is okay to be ripped/stepped on. Newspaper or large paper
                is ideal, but scratch printer paper works in a pinch.}
          @item{Enough space for everyone to walk around comfortably.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Staff spread out papers on the ground throughout the space, starting with as many papers as
there are students. Head Coach instructs students to "swim" around the space, while
explaining that they are on a tropical vacation, swimming amongst these plentiful islands
(the papers). Then all of a sudden there is a "SHARK ATTACK" and all students must safely
get on an island.

Once everyone has gotten to safety, tell the students that the shark has gone away and it
is safe to swim again. As they are swimming, remove one piece of paper from the playing
space. Another "SHARK ATTACK" comes, and everyone must still get to safety -- someone is
going to have to share their island. Explain that the point is to save as many of your
fellow vacationers as possible. Once one person is stranded; everyone loses!

The game continues, with pieces of paper getting ripped smaller or removed every round.
Once one person has been lost to the shark (hasn't been able to fit on the paper), the game
is over.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{This game is about teamwork, not competition. Kids aren't as used to that,
                and they may need some reminding that they want to save everyone!}
          @item{As usual, the more that the staff gets into the game, the more the students
                will play along!}]


@section{Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space to walk around.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

First, review the game of rock paper scissors, especially when you reveal your pick (on
"scissors" or "shoot?"). Students wander the room and find an opponent. They play RPS. The
student who loses becomes the winner's cheerleader; chanting their name and otherwise
cheering them on as they go on to find their next opponent. So it goes, with the student
who loses and all their cheerleaders joining the winner's cheer team until you have an
ultimate winner! Play this game a couple times.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{As with any competitive game, make it as lighthearted and low-stakes as
                possible. You lost this time, so what? You get to be a cheerleader! Better
                luck next time!}
          @item{Keep in mind any neighbors and noise constraints you need to make --
                whispering cheerleaders?}]


@section{Captain's Coming}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5, 6-10}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Largish space for students to be able move around safely}
          @item{List of commands and responses}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Head Coach is the captain of the ship and students are their crew. A good crew follows their
Captain's instructions to a tee! Start with the four directions (see list below) adding on new
commands as the students become comfortable -- introducing the command, demonstrating the
response, and practicing it a few times.

This may be played as an elimination game or not. If you play "with outs" have the students who
are out of the game join the Captain's team and help judge. Remind them that the Captain (and
other team leaders) are the final judges, and they are assisting. Captain can ask suggestions for
what command to say next, or they can continue to play the game behind the Captain to keep them
engaged. Students can get out by doing the wrong instruction, breaking "Captain's Coming" for
anything but "At Ease" and, if they get advance enough for numbered commands, being the odd one(s)
out.

@bold{STARTING COMMANDS:}
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item[@bold{Bow} " -- crew moves to the front of the ship (playing space)"]
          @item[@bold{Stern} " -- back of the ship"]
          @item[@bold{Port} " -- right side of the ship"]
          @item[@bold{Starboard} " -- left side of the ship"]
          @item[@bold{Captain's Coming} " -- stand at attention and hold a salute. **Do not break
                this! Not for any command (except At Ease), not to laugh, not to scratch your nose,
                never! (sneezing, breathing, etc allowed)"]
          @item[@bold{At Ease} " -- the ONLY cue to relax out of Captain's Coming"]]

@bold{ADDITIONAL COMMANDS:}
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item[@bold{Scrub the Deck} " -- hands and knees and .. well... pretend to scrub the
                ground"]
          @item[@bold{Climb the Rigging} " -- climb up in place using hands and feet (like you are
                climbing a rope ladder)"]
          @item[@bold{Hook} " --  create a hook with pointer finger and say " @italic{arr!}]
          @item[@bold{Submarine} " -- lay on your side with your arm up as your periscope. Make "
                @italic{boop boop} " submarine noises"]
          @item[@bold{Seasick} " lean over and 'vomit' **Be careful here! The sound effect here
                can get gross and out of hand. If I use this command, I put on my serious captain
                voice and tell them something like " @italic{My crew is efficient! If you gotta be
                           sick do it quick! I wanna hear a quick upchuck like *demonstrates* then
                           back to work with ye!} " Test it a few times. If you are playing with
                outs, you can establish that over-zealous seasick responses are grounds for
                elimination (not doing the command correctly!)."]]

@bold{NUMBERED & ADVANCED COMMANDS:}
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item[@bold{Swab the Deck} " sounds similar to scrub the deck, but you mop the deck
                standing as opposed to scrubbing on the ground"]
          @item[@bold{Captain's Ball} " -- find a partner and ballroom dance. " @italic{If you
                           don't have a partner, you are out!}]
          @item[@bold{Lifeboat} " -- three people sit in a line facing forward, sing "
                @italic{row row row your boat} " and row their lifeboat (in place). "
                @italic{Groups of two or fewer are out!}]
          @item[@bold{Octopus} " -- four people stand back to back and wave their tentacles (arms). "
                @italic{Groups of three or fewer are all out!}]
          @item[@bold{Starfish} " -- five people hold hands in a circle. Everyone balances on one
                leg, extending the other behind them (becoming one of the arms of the starfish). "
                @italic{Groups of four or fewer are all out!}]
          @item{... And more! Why not make up your own?}]

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Many kids will have played these types of games before and might try "correcting"
           you on the commands. Remind them that this is YOUR version and you know all the rules. ;)}
          @item{The more "Captain-y" and "Pirate-y" the Head Coach can be, the more the students
           will get into it.}
          @item{If you are feeling creative and can give this game a computer science flavor
           (instead of Captain and Crew. It's Programmer and Computer?) and come up with related
           commands, that is amazing! Go for it! And tell us about it!}]


@section{Bippity Bippity Bop}

@bold{Recommended for: 3-5, 6-10}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Enough space for everyone to stand in a circle}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Everyone circles up with the Head Coach in the middle. The HC goes to individual students on the
outside of the circle giving them different prompts. This game works best when teaching the
prompts in levels. For each level you can go around to each person in the circle and/or do it
“popcorn style” -- picking our students at random. Eventually you want to make it as random and
unpredictable as possible (I particularly like calling out the students who aren’t paying
attention!)

@bold{PROMPTS:}
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item[@bold{Level One}

                                                     before HC finishes speaking.}

          @item["Bonus - There are lots of crazy shapes that students can make when you give them

           either side strike the charlie’s angels pose and say “Hi Charlie!”). These are usually
           given a time limit (5 or ten seconds to complete). You can find a lot of these prompts
           online, for example here: "

@section{Wax Museum}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2?, 3-5}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Medium amount of space for the group to move around}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

The Head Coach uses student input to decide on a theme for the museum (Examples: Animals of the
Desert, Winter Sports, Greatest Models through History, Aliens....). One person is the "security
guard," everyone else is a statue in their museum. The guard closes their eyes and counts to 5 --
during which time, all statues are getting into a starting pose. The goal of the guard is to catch
someone moving, while the goal of the statues is to only move when the guard's back is turned. If
the guard catches a statue they are out. @bold{Important note:} no touching! Guards can't touch
statues to try and get them out and statues can't touch guards.


@bold{VARIATIONS:}

This game goes by a hundred different names and twice as many variations. Here are a few to mix
and match in your game:
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{The guard gets to pick the theme of the museum.}
          @item{Sleeping Tigers: All players are tigers instead of statues. Also, the "guard" in
           this case should try to get the tigers to move by making them laugh -- telling jokes,
           pulling funny faces, etc. Still no touching though!}
          @item{To add an extra thrill, play in semi-darkness where the guard has a flashlight/}
          @item{When out, statues become guard dogs and can help alert the guard to movement by
           barking. This can quickly get out of hand -- so prepare for a lot of noise. To try and
           contain the crazy, you can make a "dog cage" where all the dogs have to stay, out of
           the playing space.}]

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[@item{Most kids will have played a variation on this game. Be sure to introduce it as
           your version, which may be different than theirs, but also feel free to adapt the game
           to what the students know, or make new rules!}]

@section{Wah}

@bold{Recommended for: 3-5, 6-10}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle/groups of circles.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Everyone stands in a circle. The Head Coach explains the three movements of the game, palms
together for all three and all accompanied by a "Wah/Hwa/Qua" sound -- arms over head, arms down
pointing at someone else in the circle, and "chopping" side to side towards their neighbor's
middle (left or right). Now the HC explains the order; first the HC lifts their arms over their
head, on the next beat, the people on either side "chop" in toward the HC, on the next beat the
HC points to someone else in the circle. Then that person lifts their arms, their neighbors chop
in, then they point to someone else. A video for reference can be found
@(hyperlink "here" "https://youtu.be/2eKfB1tWZGg").

This is a rhythm game and the goal is to remain on beat. This can easily be an elimination game by
eliminating anyone who misses their cue or is off beat.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Explain the game to the entire group, using team leaders as examples, before
           dividing into smaller groups of 7-10 to play.}
          @item{The "Wah" is a very important part of the game, don't let it fall by the wayside!}]


@section{Human Knot}

@bold{Recommended for: 3-5, 6-10}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle/groups of circles.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

The Head Coach should demonstrate this game to all students before splitting off into individual
groups. They can even play the game with all team leaders in front of the students! Players stand
in a circle with their group. All close their eyes, reach into the middle of the circle one hand
at a time and find another hand to hold. When everyone is holding hands in one crazy knot, they
open their eyes and attempt to untangle themselves without letting go of hands.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Play in groups of 6-10, with larger groups obviously making things more challenging}
          @item{Before the game begins, go over with students the importance of being careful with
           each other’s bodies. Demonstrate how to hold hands, that it’s okay to rotate grip, what
           to do with something hurts (say “STOP” loudly. Everyone must stop).}
          @item{Team Leaders should stay out of the knot and help guide, specifically the
           "grabbing hands" bit! Keep an eye on safety but don't do the work for them!}

          @item{Set of keys (the noiser and bigger the better!)}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

All students start at the starting line. The Head Coach or "Zoo Keeper" "locks all those crazy
animals up for the night" then walks a good distance
away. They drop the keys at their feet and turn their back. Think Red Light, Green Light -- the
students try to approach the Zoo Keeper but freeze anytime the Zoo Keeper turns around. If they
are caught moving, they are sent back to the starting line.

Now here is how it differs from Red Light, Green Light. Once someone reaches the keys, the goal is
to get the keys back to the starting line as a team. Every time the Zoo Keeper turns around, the
Keeper has one guess to try and find who has the keys. If they guess correctly, that's game over
-- everyone back to the start ans the keys go back to the Keeper. It will take a couple tries to
realize, but this is not a
racing game. They are most successful when they move as a group and stick together! If there is
one student up by the Keeper when the keys disappear, well, it's pretty easy to guess.

@section{Mafia}

@bold{Recommended for: 3-5, 6-10}

There are a billion different variations on this game, including the card game " Ultimate
Werewolf." This happens to be my favorite version. 

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a seated circle/groups of circles.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

@bold{Prep:} Everyone sits in a circle, starting with their eyes closed ("asleep"). The Head Coach
is the Narrator, and they secretly assign students roles by silently tapping heads. They assign
2-3 people to be Mafia, and 1-2 people to be the Doctor(s). It is imperative that all these
assignments are top secret!

@bold{Nighttime:} The Narrator instructs the Mafia to open their eyes and SILENTLY point at one of
the sleeping townspeople to kill. The Narrator confirms (silently) then tells all Mafia to go back
to sleep. Then the Narrator asks the Doctor(s) to awake, who will then choose whom amongst the
sleeping townspeople they wish to save, also by pointing. Narrator confirms and sends them back
to sleep.

@bold{Morning:} Narrator asks everyone to wake up. This is where it gets fun! A big part of this
game is the weaving of crazy, funny, ridiculous stories -- this little town with a hidden mafia,
tragic deaths, and if you are lucky, amazing life-saving heroics. The Narrator reveals
(hopefully dramatically) who was killed in the night, and, if the Doctors' pick matches the
Mafia's, tells the amazing story of their recovery. When someone is "killed" or "jailed" they
leave the circle and become a SILENT ghost.

@bold{The Vote:} The Narrator goes around and leads a public vote of who is Mafia. Narrator
indicats each townsperson one by one, and counting the raised hands. Each townsperson holds up as
many fingers as they got votes (to keep track). Townspeople can attempt to convince each other of
who is guilty! Whoever has the most votes is thrown in prison, and joins the ghosts. Then the
whole town goes back to sleep.

Game continues in the loop of nighttime, morning, vote, nighttime, morning, vote etc. until all
the Mafia are jailed or there are no innocents left!

          @item{Warning, this is one of those games that once played, students might always beg to
           play every spare second.}
          @item{Students can become the Narrator, but it tends to be a very desirable role, so you
           may get a lot of disappointment if not everyone gets their turn.}
          @item{Narrator can give the jailed folks a chance for "last words" -- to reveal if they
           were actually Mafia or not. Or it can stay a secret until the end!}
          @item{The violence theme can be a bit too much for younger grades. If you have any
           reason to be concerned, you can not use the word "kill," instead going with a fitting
           euphemism ("sleeping with the fishes" anyone?) or trying something else all together
           (the Mafia run them out of town, they disappear, etc etc.)}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Enough space for a large standing circle/groups of circles}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Everyone is in a circle except the Head Coach, who is in the middle. The goal for the person in
the middle to get a spot on the outside. The goal for everyone else is to switch places with
someone else in the circle without losing their spot to the middle person! The people on the
outside must use silent ways of communicating to negotiate a switch, so they don't give away their
plan to the middle person. There are two ways of playing this game from here:

@itemlist[@item{BEGINNER VERSION: The person in the middle has to spend their time going up to
           people on the outside asking them "May I have your spot?" to which the outside person
           replies "No, go ask (name of someone else in the circle)." This distracts the middle
           person and gives them something to do while waiting! Also doubles as a name-learning
           game.}
          @item{ADVANCED GROUPS: The person in the middle  tries to keep an eye on everyone and
           attempts to stealspots whenever they see or hear movement.}]

When the middle person successfully snags a spot in the circle, whoever is stranded, is now in the
middle.

          @item{Groups of 10-15 work best for this game. More advanced groups can do larger games!}
          @item{Remind students of safety! Be aware of other bodies, do not run into anyone, etc.}
          @item{You may want to explicitly ban swapping with the person directly next to you if
                it keeps happening. It just takes the fun out of it!}]


@section{Ninja}

@bold{Recommended for: 6-10 (3-5 need a lot of coaching to get the rules of the game!)}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Enough space for a standing circle/groups of circles}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

The goal of this game is to hit your opponents' hands while protecting your own. It is a fast,
turn-based game, that takes a little practice, but is always a big hit!

Everyone starts in a close circle and bows to the center to start the game. Upon standing upright,
everyone immediately jumps back into their starting position (wherever and however they land,
they are frozen). Whomever is chosen to go first gets one movement to attempt to hit anyone else's
hand with their own. A movement can be just your arm or whole body jump, as long as it is a
single movement done all at the same time. Whomever they are attacking has a single move to
defend themselves at that moment (moving their hand/whole body out of the way). If their hand is
hit, they put it behind their back, having "lost" that hand. As soon as that exchange of
simultaneous moment has ended, the person to the starter player's right can attack. So it goes
around the circle, sudden attacks and defenses. When someone loses both hands, they are out of
the game. Game continues until there is only one champion ninj left!

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Definitely lead an example game in front of the whole class with team leaders and
                anyone who has played before. Explain and walk through it slowly.}
          @item{When starting out, the Head Coach may need to guide who's turn it is. Eventually,
                it's nice to stop explaining this, as the element of surprise becomes part of
                the game!}
          @item{If students start moving too far away from the game, you can establish a boundary.}]
