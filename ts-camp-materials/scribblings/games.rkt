@section{Selfie Scavenger Hunt}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th, 7th-10th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{List of things to "find" (see below for examples)}
          @item{Large space to go hunt! Good to have clear, defined borders (a non-busy
                road, sports field, unique building -- big things you cannot miss)}
          @item{Each Team Leader should have their smart phone for this activity}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Head Coach facilitates breaking up into mixed age teams, as many as there are Team
Leaders. A "count off" from a circle (assign each student a number, put all 1's with this
TL, 2's with that TL, etc) or instructing them to find their OWN team consisting of one
member from each camp group -- either works!

Head Coach explains all these rules to everyone, before sending them on their hunt:
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Stick with your team! You cannot leave any members of your team behind.}
          @item{Explain the boundaries of the Search Area.}
          @item{Each team must take a group selfie with everything on the list.*}
          @item{Give a return time!}]

* If there is a no-photos student, make them the photographer, in charge of snapping the
shot of everyone else on their team and the object.

HC should reinforce a few key points with TLs -- the boundaries and return time
especially. HC can text or give a physical list of all the items to find to each TL.

As teams return, HC checks the photos; looking for every team member in each photos and
that they got everything on the list. Celebrate every team as they return!

@bold{EXAMPLE LISTS:}
Aim for 5-10 items on the list, depending on how much time you are allowing for the hunt.
Leave some open ended items, where the thing to found might be different for everyone
(like "A Beautiful View") and include some riddles for extra fun!

Here were 2 seperate lists created for an old camp location at UCSD. Notes (not given to
teams!) are in italics:
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item["5 different things you can't do -- " @italic{There were lots of "no ___"

                                              spot!}]]

                with HQ so they can be passed on to future HCs!}]



@section{Duck Duck Goose}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle of all players, and space to run around the
                outside of the circle.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

You know how to play this game. Be safe!


@section{Follow the Leader}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Enough space for a circle of all players.}
          @item{A place for one student to go out of sight
                (ideally also out of hearing range) of the circle.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

One student is the "detective" and leaves the area (keep in mind, they need to be
accompanied but shouldn't be alone with an adult). The teacher picks one of the remaining
players to be the Leader. The Leader starts a simple movement (tapping head, clapping
hands, drumming fingers, etc) and the rest of the circle copies it. The Detective player
returns, and stands in the middle of the circle. Their job is to try and figure out who is
the Leader. Meanwhile, everyone is trying to follow the Leader as they change up the
movement, without giving away who the Leader is to the Detective. The round ends when the
Detective guesses correctly, or has three incorrect guesses.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[@item{May have to remind players not to directly stare at the Leader, but rather
                use their peripheral vision, or pay attention to someone else and match
                them!}]


@section{Shark Attack}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th, 7th-10th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Scrap paper that is okay to be ripped/stepped on. Newspaper or large paper
                is ideal, but scratch printer paper works in a pinch.}
          @item{Enough space for everyone to walk around comfortably.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Staff spread out papers on the ground throughout the space, starting with as many papers as
there are players. Head Coach instructs players to "swim" around the space, while
explaining that they are on a tropical vacation, swimming amongst these plentiful islands
(the papers). Then all of a sudden there is a "SHARK ATTACK" and all players must safely
get on an island.

Once everyone has gotten to safety, tell the players that the shark has gone away and it
is safe to swim again. As they are swimming, remove one piece of paper from the playing
space. Another "SHARK ATTACK" comes, and everyone must still get to safety -- someone is
going to have to share their island. Explain that the point is to save as many of your
fellow vacationers as possible. Once one person is stranded; everyone loses!

The game continues, with pieces of paper getting ripped smaller or removed every round.
Once one person has been lost to the shark (hasn't been able to fit on the paper), the game
is over.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{This game is about teamwork, not competition. Kids aren't as used to that,
                and they may need some reminding that they want to save everyone!}
          @item{As usual, the more that the staff gets into the game, the more the players
                will play along!}]


@section{Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space to walk around.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

First, review the game of rock paper scissors, especially when you reveal your pick (on
"scissors" or "shoot?"). Players wander the room and find an opponent. They play RPS. The
player who loses becomes the winner's cheerleader; chanting their name and otherwise
cheering them on as they go on to find their next opponent. So it goes, with the player
who loses and all their cheerleaders joining the winner's cheer team until you have an
ultimate winner! Play this game a couple times.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{As with any competitive game, make it as lighthearted and low-stakes as
                possible. You lost this time, so what? You get to be a cheerleader! Better
                luck next time!}
          @item{Keep in mind any neighbors and noise constraints you need to make --
                whispering cheerleaders?}]


@section{Captain's Coming}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th, 7th-10th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Medium to large amount of space where players can run/move quickly!}
          @item{Boundaries to the play space}
          @item{List of commands and responses}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Head Coach is the captain of the ship and players are their crew. A good crew follows their
Captain's instructions to a tee! Start with the four directions (see list below) adding on new
commands as the players become comfortable -- introducing the command, demonstrating the
response, and practicing it a few times.

This may be played as an elimination game or not. If you play "with outs" have the players who
are out of the game join the Captain's team and help judge. Remind them that the Captain (and
other team leaders) are the final judges, and they are assisting. Captain can ask suggestions for
what command to say next, or they can continue to play the game behind the Captain to keep them
engaged. Players can get out by doing the wrong instruction, breaking "Captain's Coming" for
anything but "At Ease" and, if they get advance enough for numbered commands, being the odd one(s)
out.

@bold{STARTING COMMANDS:}
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item[@bold{Bow} " -- crew moves to the front of the ship (playing space)"]
          @item[@bold{Stern} " -- back of the ship"]
          @item[@bold{Port} " -- right side of the ship"]
          @item[@bold{Starboard} " -- left side of the ship"]
          @item[@bold{Captain's Coming} " -- stand at attention and hold a salute. **Do not break
                this! Not for any command (except At Ease), not to laugh, not to scratch your nose,
                never! (sneezing, breathing, etc allowed)"]
          @item[@bold{At Ease} " -- the ONLY cue to relax out of Captain's Coming"]]

@bold{ADDITIONAL COMMANDS:}
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item[@bold{Scrub the Deck} " -- hands and knees and .. well... pretend to scrub the
                ground"]
          @item[@bold{Climb the Rigging} " -- climb up in place using hands and feet (like you are
                climbing a rope ladder)"]
          @item[@bold{Hook} " --  create a hook with pointer finger and say " @italic{arr!}]
          @item[@bold{Submarine} " -- lay on your side with your arm up as your periscope. Make "
                @italic{boop boop} " submarine noises"]
          @item[@bold{Seasick} " lean over and 'vomit' **Be careful here! The sound effect here
                can get gross and out of hand. If I use this command, I put on my serious captain
                voice and tell them something like " @italic{My crew is efficient! If you gotta be
                           sick do it quick! I wanna hear a quick upchuck like *demonstrates* then
                           back to work with ye!} " Test it a few times. If you are playing with
                outs, you can establish that over-zealous seasick responses are grounds for
                elimination (not doing the command correctly!)."]]

@bold{NUMBERED & ADVANCED COMMANDS:}
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item[@bold{Swab the Deck} " sounds similar to scrub the deck, but you mop the deck
                standing as opposed to scrubbing on the ground"]
          @item[@bold{Captain's Ball} " -- find a partner and ballroom dance. " @italic{If you
                           don't have a partner, you are out!}]
          @item[@bold{Lifeboat} " -- three people sit in a line facing forward, sing "
                @italic{row row row your boat} " and row their lifeboat (in place). "
                @italic{Groups of two or fewer are out!}]
          @item[@bold{Octopus} " -- four people stand back to back and wave their tentacles (arms). "
                @italic{Groups of three or fewer are all out!}]
          @item[@bold{Starfish} " -- five people hold hands in a circle. Everyone balances on one
                leg, extending the other behind them (becoming one of the arms of the starfish). "
                @italic{Groups of four or fewer are all out!}]
          @item{... And more! Why not make up your own?}]

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Many kids will have played these types of games before and might try "correcting"
           you on the commands. Remind them that this is YOUR version and you know all the rules. ;)}
          @item{The more "Captain-y" and "Pirate-y" the Head Coach can be, the more the players
           will get into it.}
          @item{If you are feeling creative and can give this game a computer science flavor
           (instead of Captain and Crew. It's Programmer and Computer?) and come up with related
           commands, that is amazing! Go for it! And tell us about it!}]


@section{Bippity Bippity Bop}

@bold{Recommended for: 3rd-6th, 7th-10th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Enough space for everyone to stand in a circle}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Everyone circles up with the Head Coach in the middle. The HC goes to individual players on the
outside of the circle giving them different prompts. This game works best when teaching the
prompts in levels. For each level you can go around to each person in the circle and/or do it
“popcorn style” -- picking out players at random. Eventually you want to make it as random and
unpredictable as possible (I particularly like calling out the players who aren’t paying
attention!)

@bold{PROMPTS:}

                          @item{HC says “bop!” Player must not say anything!}]]

                                                     before HC finishes speaking.}

           either side strike the charlie’s angels pose and say “Hi Charlie!”). These are usually
           given a time limit (5 or ten seconds to complete). You can find a lot of these prompts

@section{Wax Museum}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Medium amount of space for the group to move around}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

The Head Coach uses player input to decide on a theme for the museum (Examples: Animals of the
Desert, Winter Sports, Greatest Models through History, Aliens....). One person is the "security
guard," everyone else is a statue in their museum. The guard closes their eyes and counts to 5 --
during which time, all statues are getting into a starting pose. The goal of the guard is to catch
someone moving, while the goal of the statues is to only move when the guard's back is turned. If
the guard catches a statue they are out. @bold{Important note:} no touching! Guards can't touch
statues to try and get them out and statues can't touch guards.


@bold{VARIATIONS:}

This game goes by a hundred different names and twice as many variations. Here are a few to mix
and match in your game:
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{The guard gets to pick the theme of the museum.}
          @item{Sleeping Tigers: All players are tigers instead of statues. Also, the "guard" in
           this case should try to get the tigers to move by making them laugh -- telling jokes,
           pulling funny faces, etc. Still no touching though!}
          @item{To add an extra thrill, play in semi-darkness where the guard has a flashlight/}
          @item{When out, statues become guard dogs and can help alert the guard to movement by
           barking. This can quickly get out of hand -- so prepare for a lot of noise. To try and
           contain the crazy, you can make a "dog cage" where all the dogs have to stay, out of
           the playing space.}]

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[@item{Most kids will have played a variation on this game. Be sure to introduce it as
           your version, which may be different than theirs, but also feel free to adapt the game
           to what the players know, or make new rules!}]

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle/groups of circles.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Everyone stands in a circle. The Head Coach explains the three movements of the game, palms
together for all three and all accompanied by a "Wah/Hwa/Qua" sound -- arms over head, arms down
pointing at someone else in the circle, and "chopping" side to side towards their neighbor's
middle (left or right). Now the HC explains the order; first the HC lifts their arms over their
head, on the next beat, the people on either side "chop" in toward the HC, on the next beat the
HC points to someone else in the circle. Then that person lifts their arms, their neighbors chop
in, then they point to someone else. A video for reference can be found
@(hyperlink "here" "https://youtu.be/2eKfB1tWZGg").

This is a rhythm game and the goal is to remain on beat. This can easily be an elimination game by
eliminating anyone who misses their cue or is off beat.

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle/groups of circles.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

The Head Coach should demonstrate this game to all players before splitting off into individual
groups. They can even play the game with all team leaders in front of the players! Players stand
in a circle with their group. All close their eyes, reach into the middle of the circle one hand
at a time and find another hand to hold. When everyone is holding hands in one crazy knot, they
open their eyes and attempt to untangle themselves without letting go of hands.

          @item{A starting line marker (could be a tree, could bring two chairs outside, super
                easy)}
          @item{Set of keys (the noiser and bigger the better!)}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

All players start at the starting line. The Head Coach or "Zoo Keeper" "locks all those crazy
animals up for the night" then walks a good distance
away. They drop the keys at their feet and turn their back. Think Red Light, Green Light -- the
players try to approach the Zoo Keeper but freeze anytime the Zoo Keeper turns around. If they
are caught moving, they are sent back to the starting line.

Now here is how it differs from Red Light, Green Light. Once someone reaches the keys, the goal is
to get the keys back to the starting line as a team. Every time the Zoo Keeper turns around, the
Keeper has one guess to try and find who has the keys. If they guess correctly, that's game over
-- everyone back to the start ans the keys go back to the Keeper. It will take a couple tries to
realize, but this is not a
racing game. They are most successful when they move as a group and stick together! If there is
one player up by the Keeper when the keys disappear, well, it's pretty easy to guess.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@section{Mafia}

@bold{Recommended for: 3rd-6th, 7th-10th}

There are a billion different variations on this game, including the card game " Ultimate
Werewolf." This happens to be my favorite version. 

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a seated circle/groups of circles.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

@bold{Prep:} Everyone sits in a circle, starting with their eyes closed ("asleep"). The Head Coach
is the Narrator, and they secretly assign players roles by silently tapping heads. They assign
2-3 people to be Mafia, and 1-2 people to be the Doctor(s). It is imperative that all these
assignments are top secret!

@bold{Nighttime:} The Narrator instructs the Mafia to open their eyes and SILENTLY point at one of
the sleeping townspeople to kill. The Narrator confirms (silently) then tells all Mafia to go back
to sleep. Then the Narrator asks the Doctor(s) to awake, who will then choose whom amongst the
sleeping townspeople they wish to save, also by pointing. Narrator confirms and sends them back
to sleep.

@bold{Morning:} Narrator asks everyone to wake up. This is where it gets fun! A big part of this
game is the weaving of crazy, funny, ridiculous stories -- this little town with a hidden mafia,
tragic deaths, and if you are lucky, amazing life-saving heroics. The Narrator reveals
(hopefully dramatically) who was killed in the night, and, if the Doctors' pick matches the
Mafia's, tells the amazing story of their recovery. When someone is "killed" or "jailed" they
leave the circle and become a SILENT ghost.

@bold{The Vote:} The Narrator goes around and leads a public vote of who is Mafia. Narrator
indicats each townsperson one by one, and counting the raised hands. Each townsperson holds up as
many fingers as they got votes (to keep track). Townspeople can attempt to convince each other of
who is guilty! Whoever has the most votes is thrown in prison, and joins the ghosts. Then the
whole town goes back to sleep.

Game continues in the loop of nighttime, morning, vote, nighttime, morning, vote etc. until all
the Mafia are jailed or there are no innocents left!

          @item{The violence theme can be a bit too much for younger grades. If you have any
           reason to be concerned, you can not use the word "kill," instead going with a fitting

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Enough space for a large standing circle/groups of circles}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Everyone is in a circle except the Head Coach, who is in the middle. The goal for the person in
the middle to get a spot on the outside. The goal for everyone else is to switch places with
someone else in the circle without losing their spot to the middle person! The people on the
outside must use silent ways of communicating to negotiate a switch, so they don't give away their
plan to the middle person. There are two ways of playing this game from here:

@itemlist[@item{BEGINNER VERSION: The person in the middle has to spend their time going up to
           people on the outside asking them "May I have your spot?" to which the outside person
           replies "No, go ask (name of someone else in the circle)." This distracts the middle
           person and gives them something to do while waiting! Also doubles as a name-learning
           game.}
          @item{ADVANCED GROUPS: The person in the middle  tries to keep an eye on everyone and
           attempts to stealspots whenever they see or hear movement.}]

When the middle person successfully snags a spot in the circle, whoever is stranded, is now in the
middle.

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

The goal of this game is to hit your opponents' hands while protecting your own. It is a fast,
turn-based game, that takes a little practice, but is always a big hit!

Everyone starts in a close circle and bows to the center to start the game. Upon standing upright,
everyone immediately jumps back into their starting position (wherever and however they land,
they are frozen). Whomever is chosen to go first gets one movement to attempt to hit anyone else's
hand with their own. A movement can be just your arm or whole body jump, as long as it is a
single movement done all at the same time. Whomever they are attacking has a single move to
defend themselves at that moment (moving their hand/whole body out of the way). If their hand is
hit, they put it behind their back, having "lost" that hand. As soon as that exchange of
simultaneous moment has ended, the person to the starter player's right can attack. So it goes
around the circle, sudden attacks and defenses. When someone loses both hands, they are out of
the game. Game continues until there is only one champion ninj left!

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

This game can be played standing or sitting. Players pair up and pick one of the two to guess
first. The Guesser has 15-30 seconds to visually memorize their partner. Once the
time is up, Guessers close their eyes, and their partner now changes one thing about their
appearance: remove an earring, put their watch on the other wrist,
untie their shoelaces on one shoe, cuff their pants...

At their partner's OK, Guessers open their eyes and try to find what their partner has changed.
When they guess correct, the roles swap and the game begins again.

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Recommended Instructional Video: @(hyperlink "https://youtu.be/DHMxfA2OivI" "Hand Game Video")

Everyone circles up. All players put
their hands, palms down, on the ground in front of them. Everyone lifts their right hand and
places it on the other side of the left hand of the person directly to their right -- ending up
with everyone's arms overlapping and criss-crossed.

Starting player taps their right hand on the ground. The taps continue clockwise around the
circle in the order of hands on the ground, not players! Any player who taps their hand out of
order, or is too delayed in realizing it is their turn to tap, pulls that hand from the circle.
When both of a player's hands are pulled out, they are out. Play continues until there is one (or
a couple) winners remaining!

In addition to tapping hands clockwise, there are a couple ways to change the flow that any
player can do instead of a single tap on their turn:
@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Double-tap -- tapping two times (quickly!) reverses the direction of the slaps}

          @item{Pens/Markers, potentially}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

@bold{Standard Version} -- Head Coach tapes a slip of paper with the a famous name that everyone
should know (fictional character, historical figure, modern celebrity) to the back of every
player. @bold{Players should not know what has been taped to their own back!} Once all players
have a name, the game starts:

All players are trying to guess "who they are". They get clues by
asking @bold{yes or no} questions of the other players (Example questions: "Am I alive today?"
"Am I liked?" "Do I act in movies?" etc). Make sure they turn around to show off who they are
first! In turn, they will answer questions for
other players trying to figure out who they are! Once a player has successfully guessed, they can
move their paper off their back, place it on the front of their shirt and continue to help
other players by answering their questions.

@bold{Variation for younger players} -- Instead of characters, use animals. Questions adjust to
"Do I live on land?" "Do I walk on 4 legs?" "Do people have me as a pet?"

@bold{Variation for older players} -- Have the players write the names instead of prepping them
beforehand. Give them parameters (at the least: something everyone will know. Can be more
specific, characters from movies, historical figures, another specific category). Make sure no one
gets the name they wrote.

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Pair up all players; have each pair decide who is the artist first and who is the designer. The
artist gets a pencil/pen and paper and the designer gets a chromebook with a browser open to
@(hyperlink "http://www.byrdseed.com/emoji/" "byrdseed.com/emoji"). The partners sit back to back, and the
designer clicks the "start over" button to generate a new emoji.

Head Coach starts a timer for 2 minutes. The designer describes to the best of their ability
what the emoji looks like -- getting as detailed as possible (not just "sad face emoji"!). At
the end of the time, the art and emoji are revealed, laughter and/or celebration is had, and
roles are swapped for the next round.

@bold{Variation with a Projector} -- if there is a projector available, give this version a try!
Head Coach projects up one of the pages listed below, with several random images displayed.

          @item{An even number of players}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

All players pair up, finding a spot in the playspace to stand side-by-side, elbows linked. Head
Coach picks a single person to start as "it" and that person's partner better run! Everyone else
is safe from the "it" player; when you are linked with one other person you are safe and must
remain in place.

The Runner can become "safe" at any time by linking on to the end of a pair. But this immediately
"kicks-out" the partner on the @italic{other} end of the pair, who is now on the run! The "it"
player is attempting to tag whomever is solo at the moment (even if they haven't realized they
are yet!). If tagged, the Runner becomes "it" and "it" becomes the Runner, who can now link up
and rest!

@itemlist[#:style 'compact

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Two players start as "it." They hold hands and run as a team, attempting to tag other players
with their free hands. When they are successful, the tagged player joins hands with them and
becomes part of the "it amoeba." Only the members at the end of the line, the most recently
tagged, can tag people with their free hands, but the rest of the team can help surround and trap
the players they are chasing! The game continues, with the "it amoeba" becoming larger and

One or two players start as "it" -- or in this case, the Shark(s)! The rest of the players, the
Minnows, split between the two end zones. When the Shark(s) cries out "Fishy fishy, cross my ocean,"
all Minnows run from their end zone to the other, while the Shark(s) tries to tag them. If they are
tagged, they becomes Seaweed -- stays exactly where they were tagged, with feet planted, and tries
to tag other Minnows as they "swim by" without moving their feet. Once everyone has made it
across or been tagged, Shark(s) call everyone to cross again!

@subsection{What Time Is It, Mr. Wolf? Tag}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Large amount of space safe for running -- with defined boundaries!}
          @item{A defined starting line}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

One player is "it" -- or "Mr. Wolf." This player stands a good distance from the starting line with
their back to the line. All other players collect on the starting line. All together, the players
ask "What time is it, Mr. Wolf?" Mr. Wolf responds with any time -- ending with "o'clock." The
players take that number of steps forward, towards Mr. Wolf (example: 5 steps for "five o'clock").

At any time, Mr. Wolf can reply with "DINNER TIME!" at which point, they will turn around and
chase all players back to the starting line, trying to tag them before they get there. If Mr.
Wolf is successful, a new Mr. Wolf is chosen from the players tagged.

@subsection{Clam Free Tag}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3rd-6th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Large amount of space safe for running -- with defined boundaries!}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

One or two players are "it" -- or the "Clam Diggers". Played like freeze tag -- when the other
players are tagged they must freeze in place and wait to be freed. Additionally, they signal that
they need to be freed by communicating to their fellow clams with the offical clam-help signal:
bringing both hands up to shoulder-level, making puppet-mouths and saying, in a very high-pitched
voice "help-me-help-me-help-me!" until help arrives!

Stuck clams are freed when two of their fellow clams grab hands around them, lift their hand up
shouting "CLAM FREE!"

@subsection{Bring Home the Bacon Tag}

@bold{Recommended for: 3rd-6th, 7th-10th}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Large amount of space safe for running -- with defined boundaries!}
          @item{Defined "homes" on opposing sides of the playspace}
          @item{An even number of players}
          @item{"Bacon" -- an item that can be grabbed from the center. This can be a ball, a
                shoe, a lunch bag, etc.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Divide the players into two teams and assign each member of the team a number -- there should be
one of each number on each team. Teams line up on opposing sides of the playing space at their
"home." The "bacon" -- a random grabbable object -- is placed in the center of the
playspace.

Head Coach calls out a number. The players on both teams assigned to that number race to the
center to grab the "bacon." Whomever gets it first races back to their "home" while the other
player tries to tag them. If the player manages to bring home the bacon without getting tagged,
they earn their team a point! If they get tagged, no one earns a point. Reset and call out a
new number.

@itemlist[#:style 'compact
          @item{Head Coach can also call out groups of numbers -- such as all evens, odds, 3 and
                under, 2 and over, etc.}
          @item{If you are feeling extra tricky, add some math! Call out "all numbers divisible
                by 3" etc.}
          @item{Bring along a white board to keep score!}
          @item{Can play to 10 points or to the highest score by the end of game time.}]
