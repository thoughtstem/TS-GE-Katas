@title{Camp Games}

Games to play during camp game time! Roughly organized by recommended age group.

@section{Duck Duck Goose}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle of all players, and space to run around the
                outside of the circle.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

You know how to play this game. Be safe!


@section{Follow the Leader}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space for a circle of all players.}
          @item{A place for one student to go out of sight
                (ideally also out of hearing range) of the circle.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

One student is the "detective" and leaves the area (keep in mind, they need to be
accompanied but shouldn't be alone with an adult). The teacher picks one of the remaining
students to be the Leader. The Leader starts a simple movement (tapping head, clapping
hands, drumming fingers, etc) and the rest of the circle copies it. The Detective student
returns, and stands in the middle of the circle. Their job is to try and figure out who is
the Leader. Meanwhile, everyone is trying to follow the Leader as they change up the
movement, without giving away who the Leader is to the Detective. The round ends when the
Detective guesses correctly, or has three incorrect guesses.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[@item{May have to remind students not to directly stare at the Chief, but rather
                use their peripheral vision, or pay attention to someone else and match
                them!}]


@section{Shark Attack}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Scrap paper that is okay to be ripped/stepped on. Newspaper or large paper
                is ideal, but scratch printer paper works in a pinch.}
          @item{Enough space for everyone to walk around comfortably.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

Staff spread out papers on the ground throughout the space, starting with as many papers as
there are students. Head Coach instructs students to "swim" around the space, while
explaining that they are on a tropical vacation, swimming amongst these plentiful islands
(the papers). Then all of a sudden there is a "SHARK ATTACK" and all students must safely
get on an island.

Once everyone has gotten to safety, tell the students that the shark has gone away and it
is safe to swim again. As they are swimming, remove one piece of paper from the playing
space. Another "SHARK ATTACK" comes, and everyone must still get to safety -- someone is
going to have to share their island. Explain that the point is to save as many of your
fellow vacationers as possible. Once one person is stranded; everyone loses!

The game continues, with pieces of paper getting ripped smaller or removed every round.
Once one person has been lost to the shark (hasn't been able to fit on the paper), the game
is over.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[@item{This game is about teamwork, not competition. Kids aren't as used to that,
                and they may need some reminding that they want to save everyone!}
          @item{As usual, the more that the staff gets into the game, the more the students
                will play along!}]


@section{Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors}

@bold{Recommended for: K-2nd, 3-5}

@bold{NEED:}

@itemlist[@item{Enough space to walk around.}]

@bold{HOW TO PLAY:}

First, review the game of rock paper scissors, especially when you reveal your pick (on
"scissors" or "shoot?"). Students wander the room and find an opponent. They play RPS. The
student who loses becomes the winner's cheerleader; chanting their name and otherwise
cheering them on as they go on to find their next opponent. So it goes, with the student
who loses and all their cheerleaders joining the winner's cheer team until you have an
ultimate winner! Play this game a couple times.

@bold{TIPS & TRICKS:}

@itemlist[@item{As with any competitive game, make it as lighthearted and low-stakes as
                possible. You lost this time, so what? You get to be a cheerleader! Better
                luck next time!}
          @item{Keep in mind any neighbors and noise constraints you need to make --
                whispering cheerleaders?}]
