@defproc[(collection->folder [kc kata-collection?] [dest path?]) voide?]{
  Outputs the katas in the collection into the specified folders.
  
  Cards will be given names like @racket["card-025.png"].  Even numbered
  cards are the fronts, and odds are the back.  Furthermore, fronts will be 
  placed into a subdirectory front/, and backs will be placed into a subdirectory
  back/

  Here is the starting point for doing a print order:

Some common print jobs (implemented with the above):

@defproc[(battle-arena-base->Desktop) void?]{
  Puts the battle-arena base language katas into a folder called "battle-arena-katas"
  on your Desktop.
}
