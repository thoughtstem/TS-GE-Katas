@; ------ PRACTICE JAM

@section{Paper Practice Kata}

@margin-note*{Teaching Tip: Students should start coding this first and then they can customize their game.}

To earn this kata @(meta-kata) they need to:

@italic{Code a simple survival game in under 25 minutes.}

@codeblock{
 #lang ts-game-jam-1

 (survival-game
  #:avatar       (custom-avatar)

  #:food-list    (list (custom-food #:amount-in-world 10))
  #:npc-list     (list (custom-npc))
  #:crafter-list (list (custom-crafter)))}

If they complete this in less than 25 minutes during game jam they would
earn the following number of points:

@itemlist[@item{Avatar:  @bold{+1} Having an avatar 
                         @bold{+5} in less than 5 minutes
