@title{Training Recommendations}

The Game Jam is not easy.  The tight time constraints require competitors to have a high level
of mastery over various aspects of game design.

Mastery is the key word here.   It is not enough to have simply "been exposed" to some concept.
That is familiarity -- not mastery.

The training program given here is intended to give students mastery over the skills needed
to excel at the Scholastic Game Jam.

It is also intended to be fun!  Mastery requires repetition.  Mastery requires holding oneself
to high standards.  Sometimes it can be a challenge to keep having fun while pursuing mastery.
The following curriculum is intended to keep the road to mastery as fun as possible.

At the end of the day, though, the main ingredient to fun is the energy of the coach.  If you're
a coach, whether you follow these recommendations or not, keep in mind that if you're excited
about the Game Jam, your competitors will be too.  If you're excited about your competitors'
ascendency to mastery, they will be too.

Be loud.  Be proud.  Be a coach.
